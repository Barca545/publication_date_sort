| StoryTitle1         = Scars
| Synopsis1           = 
The Huntress comes to [[Earth-One]], seeking advice from [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-One)|Batman]], the counterpart of [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|her father]] on [[Earth-Two]]. Shortly afterwards, Batman and [[Richard Grayson (Earth-One)|Robin]] go in search of [[Desmond Mallard (Earth-One)|Scar]], a maniac responsible for kidnapping people and turning them into grotesqueries, and who has kidnapped Dick's girlfriend, [[Lori Elton (Earth-One)|Lori Elton]].

Batman decides to introduce Huntress to [[Katherine Kane (Earth-One)|Kathy Kane]], as he considers she would provide her with better advice for her crime-fighting career. While on Kathy's amusement park, Batman picks up the trail of Scar and although he manages to find the criminal's lair, Batman is captured by the madman, who prepares a trap that would deform Lori's face. After Scar explains the motives for his crimes, he leaves the chamber, leaving Batman tied-up, so he could witness Lori's deformation.

Meanwhile, Robin has found the trace of Scar and goes to the amusement park after dark, where he confronts the criminal and delays his escape, allowing Batman catch up with him, even after freeing himself from the trap and save Lori. Robin goes to Lori as Dick to help her after the event and Batman corners Scar in the house of mirrors, where the criminal is forced to face his own traumas.

| StoryTitle2         = Horoscopes of Crime!
| Synopsis2           = 
Kathy Kane and Helena Wayne discuss after they were formally introduced by Batman, but Kathy suggests that Helena should seek advice from an active crime-fighter like [[Barbara Gordon (Earth-One)|Batgirl]]. Like this, they prepare to make a trip to meet with Barbara Gordon.

Meanwhile, [[Selina Kyle (Earth-One)|Catwoman]] and [[Pamela Isley (New Earth)|Poison Ivy]] are informed by a fortune teller called [[Madame Zodiac (New Earth)|Madame Zodiac]] that their upcoming crimes are most likely to be thwarted by Batgirl and Huntress. Not listening to Zodiac's advice, the evil-doers continue with their capers and they are in fact, confronted by the heroines. However, they are both assisted by Zodiac and they manage to get away, despite being unsuccessful in their crimes.

Afterwards, Barbara, Kathy and Helena get to talk and show their support and admiration for each other. Meanwhile, the criminals plan their next heist and they agree to work together to rob a museum. During this crime, the lady crooks are once again stopped by the heroes and this time, Zodiac is also stopped by Batwoman. Poison Ivy and Catwoman are helplessly captured, but Zodiac manages to escape with a very important relic from the museum.

| StoryTitle3         = There's a Demon Born Every Minute
| Synopsis3           = 
After the Huntress has talked with Batman and Batgirl, she returns to [[Earth-Two]] using the inter-dimensional transporter in the [[Justice League Satellite]]. During this travel, the dimensional barrier is breached, allowing [[Morgaine le Fey (New Earth)|Morgaine le Fey]] to enter [[Earth-One]]'s realm and capture the [[Philosopher's Stone]].

Shortly after this, [[Jason Blood (New Earth)|Jason Blood]] is informed of Morgaine's activities in [[New York City]] and he travels there as fast as he can.

Meanwhile in NYC, [[Kirk Langstrom (Earth-One)|Kirk Langstrom]] is waiting at the Maternity Hospital for his wife to give birth to their child. However, several new-borns are transformed into demons by le Fey, forcing Man-Bat and [[Etrigan (New Earth)|Etrigan]] to step up and confront le Fey. With the power of the Stone, Morgaine has become much more powerful than Etrigan and Man-Bat, but the latter transforms back into his human form to take the Stone from her posession, taking away her powers and he then uses the stone to transform her into a statue.

Giving the stone back to Etrigan, Langstrom returns to the hospital, where he finally learns that [[Francine Lee (Earth-One)|Francine]] has given birth to their daughter, [[Rebecca Langstrom (Earth-One)|Rebecca]].

| StoryTitle1         = Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader? Part 2
| Synopsis1           = 
Batman is present at his own funeral and he witness how people he knows, both as enemies and allies, keep telling eulogies, but all of them are different stories about his life and his death. Some of these stories include [[Elizabeth Kane (Earth-One)|Bat-Girl]]'s story of how Batman sacrificed himself to save Gotham from its destruction and also [[Joker (New Earth)|Joker]]'s story about how he killed Batman with an overdose of [[Joker Venom]], but Batman refused to smile even in the face of death. Then, [[Richard Grayson (New Earth)|Robin]] started his story and how he managed to outgrew his mentor after his death. [[Basil Karlo (New Earth)|Clayface]] tells about Batman's sacrifice to save him and [[Harvey Bullock (New Earth)|Harvey Bullock]] tells the story about the time when Batman sacrificed his life to save a little child.

Despite being absolutely different, all the stories seem to focus on the fact that Batman inspired both his trusted friends and his most lethal enemies. [[Ra's al Ghul (New Earth)|Ra's al Gul]] explains how Batman refused to join him and how he was killed by a scorpion sting during their fateful confrontation. At last, [[Kal-El (New Earth)|Superman]] talks how he saved Batman from a plot to kill him in Gotham, but after Batman's request, he returned him to Gotham, where he met his demise.

{{Image|Martha Wayne 0001.jpg|Martha Wayne in Batman's mind|right}}Finally, Batman's extracorporeal conscience talks to the woman's voice near him and he starts to understand what is happening at the moment. After a while, Batman notices a door that wasn't there before and crosses the threshold, leaving the waking room behind and entering a place of almost complete darkness. A woman's figure is standing in a spotlight and Batman approaches her, understanding that what he is experiencing at the moment is known as a near-death experience. When Batman reaches the woman, he finally is reunited with his mother, [[Martha Kane (New Earth)|Martha Wayne]], who asks Bruce what has he learned of his experience so far. Bruce has learned that no matter what happens, Batman will always keep Gotham City safe, because he never gives in. He also finally understands that Batman can never stop being Batman to live a normal life, but instead, he must always keep going until he falls in battle. As he comes to this realization, Batman remembers past events from his own history including the time when the GCPD would chase him as a criminal, his first encounter with [[Kirk Langstrom (New Earth)|Man-Bat]], the time when Joker gained control of Arkham Asylum, his affair with [[Talia al Ghul (New Earth)|Talia]] and his big defeat at the hands of [[Bane (New Earth)|Bane]].

As this goes in Batman's mind, Martha tells her that he is absolutely right about everything. She then starts remembering the time they spent together, reading the "Goodnight Book", right before going out to see a movie. At that moment, an elderly Joe Chill feels a ghostly presence in his bar. Martha then recalls the moment of her death along with her husband and how Bruce witnessed the scene.

Batman finally understands that this is his near-death experience and he deduces that he must be about to wake up in a hospital or elsewhere, barely alive, but Martha tells him otherwise. This time, his death is inevitable, but Batman doesn't believe in the afterlife and doesn't understand what else could be there for him. Martha takes Bruce to see his own corpse one last time and she tells him that the only fate that awaits him is to be Batman. She explains that the cycle will start again and he would have a few years of true happiness before embracing his destiny. Martha then transforms into a celestial being and tells Bruce that it is time, and just like he did as a child reading the "Goodnight Book", he must now say goodbye to everything he knows.

Batman starts saying goodnight to [[Wayne Manor]], the [[Batcave]], the mechanical dinosaur and the [[Giant Penny]]; to the [[Batmobile]], Alfred, Robin, Joker, Jim Gordon, all the rogues gallery, Gotham City and finally the [[Bat-Signal]]. As everything around descends into darkness, the Bat-Signal keeps shining bright and soon, it starts changing into the shape of a couple of hands that reach for a newborn baby boy which is handed to Martha Wayne in the hospital. She smiles down at the baby and calls him Bruce.

| StoryTitle1         = Last Days of the Justice Society
| Synopsis1           = 
Following the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis On Infinite Earths]], the remaining surviving members of the Justice Society along with [[Wesley Dodds (New Earth)|Sandman's]] partner [[Sanderson Hawkins (New Earth)|Sandy]] and [[Carter Hall (New Earth)|Hawkman's]] wife [[Shiera Sanders (New Earth)|Hawkgirl]] gather in the estate of Carter Hall in a funeral service for [[Helena Wayne (Earth-Two)|Helena Wayne]] and the Earth-Two [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Dick Grayson]], whom they knew became the Huntress and the Earth-Two Robin. They also realize that with the merging of the universes, there is one single universe that has formed, with one Earth on which most of the surviving superheroes (from those universes) now coexist and their own team has become redundant and past their time. Earth-Two Hawkman calls for the Justice Society to be immediately disbanded when the [[Aztar (New Earth)|Spectre]] appears unto them, crying out in pain before he collapses. [[Kent Nelson (New Earth)|Dr. Fate]] touches the Spectre and is immediately flooded with images of something that took place in 1945, something that is far different from what the rest of the Justice Society team that was active at the time remembers:

:''On the day of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt (New Earth)|Franklin D. Roosevelt's]] funeral, the Justice Society sees a rip in the sky, which they surmise is another reality trying to enter into theirs. The members with the power of flight attempt to fly into the rip to investigate, but they are soon repelled. The Spectre reveals that the point of origin of the "rip in the sky" is from Germany, which makes the team as well as President [[Harry S. Truman (New Earth)|Harry S. Truman]] realize that [[Adolf Hitler (New Earth)|Adolf Hitler]] has a powerful mystical weapon that he intends to use not only against the Allied troops, but also against the whole world. The Justice Society travels as far as they dare outside the limits of the Sphere of Influence, then bravely enter into that zone without [[Kal-L (Earth-Two)|Superman]] and all superheroes with magic-based powers, only to be picked off one by one by Nazi troops as they enter into the bunker where Adolf Hitler is using the Ancient Spear of Destiny. Though Hawkman survives long enough to confront Hitler, it is too late: fire pours into the room and devours its inhabitants, then it spreads throughout the whole Earth, devouring everything on it and the planet itself, until nothing remains.''

After revealing this alternate history to the Justice Society members of the present time, Dr. Fate shows them that the "rip in the sky" is now over them at this point in time: what Hitler had done in 1945 with the Ancient Spear of Destiny is now coursing its way through time. Dr. Fate now transports the team back in time to 1945, to the point where they see that Hitler has started using the Spear to cause a worldwide catastrophe, and he reveals that Hitler has tapped into the power of the Spectre, while he was lying dormant following his confrontation with the [[Anti-Monitor]], to make the catastrophe happen. Dr. Fate takes the heroes to the world of Asgard, the home of the Nordic gods, also revealing that Hitler has linked the fate of their Ragnarok, the "twilight of the gods", to that of the universe.

Knowing that the only way to keep Hitler's linkage of the Ragnarok to the universe's destruction from taking place is to change the course of the Ragnarok's outcome, Dr. Fate merges the members of the Justice Society along with Sandy and Hawkgirl with the Nordic gods who are out to battle the demons come to destroy them. Team members [[Jason Garrick (New Earth)|Flash]], [[John Thunder (New Earth)|Johnny Thunder]], [[Alan Scott (New Earth)|Green Lantern]], [[Theodore Knight (New Earth)|Starman]], Hawkman, Hawkgirl, and [[Ted Grant (New Earth)|Wildcat]] perish in the battle, but as the Justice Society prevails until there is only Surtur the fiery demon left to battle, the perished team members are brought back to life and they all join together for the defeat of Surtur -- everyone except for [[Kara Zor-L (Earth-Two)|Power Girl]] and the [[Sylvester Pemberton (New Earth)|Star-Spangled Kid]], who have been purposely withdrawn by Dr. Fate from this confrontation. As the Justice Society defeats Surtur, Power Girl and Star-Spangled Kid see that the whole battle is starting all over. Dr. Fate reveals that the battle must be repeated over and over in order to protect the universe from the intended fate of the Ragnarok. He transports them out of Asgard and back to the Hall Estate in the present time, then is soon transported there by the Spectre who now joins with his Master. Dr. Fate now informs the members of Infinity, Inc. what has transpired.

As the course of the Ragnarok is changed, Hitler sees that his plans to destroy the world have been defeated. He eventually marries his mistress [[Eva Braun (New Earth)|Eva Braun]] and they retreat into their underground suite, where they both poison themselves and commit suicide.

| Notes               = 
* This story takes place in late [[1985]], a few months after the events of {{c|Crisis on Infinite Earths Vol 1 12}}.
* The events of {{c|Sandman Vol 2 26}} reveal that the world of the eternal Ragnarök is actually an alternate dimension created by the [[New Earth|"''real''"]] [[Pre-Flashpoint]] [[Odin (New Earth)|Odin]] to simulate the Twilight of the Gods and find a way to prevent the Asgardians' deaths.
** With Dr. Fate's magic, the JSAers are fused with Norse gods during the Ragnarök battle. Green Lantern is fused with Thor; Flash, with Frey; Hawkman, with Odin; Starman, with Heimdall; Wildcat, with Tyr; Atom, with Vidar.
* This is the last time we see the Justice Society members except for Power Girl, Star-Spangled Kid, Spectre, and Doctor Fate participate in any present-day stories on [[New Earth]] until 1992. They remain locked in the Ragnarok battle until ''{{c|Armageddon: Inferno Vol 1 3}}&amp;ndash;{{c|Armageddon: Inferno Vol 1 4|4}}'', in which they are replaced by [[Abraxis (New Earth)|Abraxis]]' [[Daemen (New Earth)|daemen]]. The story was originally intended to be a retirement of using the Justice Society in present-day stories, with the focus shifting on their continued Golden Age adventures in {{v|Young All-Stars Vol 1}} and those of their original Earth-Two successor group [[Infinity, Inc. (New Earth)|Infinity, Inc]].
** {{c|Infinity Inc. Vol 1 30}} deals with the members of that team mourning the disappearance of the Justice Society in this story. Prior to this, in issue {{c|Infinity Inc. Vol 1 27|#27}}, Brainwave Jr. helps ease the suffering of Lyta Trevor remembering her pre-Crisis past of being the daughter of the Golden Age/Earth-Two Wonder Woman by erasing her memories of such.
** This story is also briefly recapped in {{C|Armageddon: Inferno Vol 1 3}}, though instead of the Spectre being laid low by his confrontation at the Dawn of Time with the Anti-Monitor in {{c|Crisis on Infinite Earths Vol 1 10}}, he was struck by the Ancient Spear of Destiny thrown by [[Jeffrey Franklin Burr (New Earth)|Kobra]] as he attempted to steal it from a museum.
* Though the story happens after the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], there are still [[Pre-Crisis]] elements in the continuity of [[New Earth]], particularly in the 1945 flashback sequences where we still see the [[Golden Age]] versions of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman among the gathered Justice Society heroes present. The "sweeping effects" of the Crisis have not yet taken hold at this point, and in the 1940s do not take hold until [[Mekanique (New Earth)|Mekanique]] releases them in {{c|All-Star Squadron Vol 1 60}}.
* Some details from the continuity of [[Earth-Two]] are confirmed in this story:
** [[1928]] is given as the birth year of Dick Grayson;
** [[1957]] is given for Helena Wayne's year of birth;
** The death of Earth-Two's Bruce Wayne is still confirmed to be [[1979]].
* Hawkgirl and Sandy the Golden Boy participate with the group in this story, though at the time they were not officially members of the Justice Society.
* During the battle, a caption mentions Canadian forces taking "Arnhem, Belgium", and American forces marching up to the Zuider Zee River. Arnhem is in [[The Netherlands]], and there is no Zuider Zee River, as the {{WP|Zuiderzee}} was a bay.
* This issue is reprinted in {{co|Last Days of the Justice Society of America (Collected)}}.
| Trivia              = 
* The adventures of the four surviving heroes of the Justice Society continue in other angles of the [[DC Universe]]:
** Power Girl becomes independent for a few years before she joins the [[Justice League International (New Earth)|Justice League International]] in the 1990s. She rejoins the Justice Society in the 2000s, learning that her post-Crisis history of being born the granddaughter of the Atlantean sorcerer [[Ahri'ahn (New Earth)|Arion]] was a lie. She also briefly reunited with her Earth-Two cousin [[Kal-L (Earth-Two)|Kal-L]] during the events of the [[Infinite Crisis]] until he died at the hands of [[Superboy-Prime]].
** Star-Spangled Kid adopts the new identity of Skyman and continues as the leader of Infinity, Inc. until his death at the hands of [[Injustice Unlimited (Earth-Two)|Injustice Unlimited]].
** Doctor Fate gathers up heroes to deal with [[Glorious Godfrey (New Earth)|Glorious Godfrey]] during [[Darkseid (New Earth)|Darkseid's]] [[Operation Humiliation]] and becomes a member of the Justice League, dealing with a "change of personnel" during his time with the League. He rejoins the Justice Society during the time of [[Zero Hour]], where Kent and [[Inza Cramer (New Earth)|Inza Nelson]] would perish at the hands of [[Henry Hall (New Earth)|Extant]]. Their power is briefly wielded by [[Jared Stevens (New Earth)|Jared Stevens]] before the mantle of Doctor Fate is later passed on to a resurrected Hector Hall who becomes a member of the Justice Society.
** The Spectre returns to active duty as a superhero, mostly going independent and going through changes in abilities as well as "changes in personnel", eventually switching from Jim Corrigan to [[Hal Jordan (New Earth)|Hal Jordan]] to final host [[Crispus Allen (New Earth)|Crispus Allen]].
*** The Spectre's story chronologically continues in {{c|Spectre Vol 2 1}}.
* The bodies of both the Huntress and the Earth-Two Robin were claimed to never have been found at the end of {{c|Crisis on Infinite Earths Vol 1 12}}.
* The Spectre mentions ''an event'' that he and Doctor Fate recently took part in. This is a reference to the clash against the [[Great Darkness]] from {{c|Swamp Thing Vol 2 50}}.
* The death of Adolf Hitler in this issue is portrayed concurrently in {{c|Weird War Tales Vol 1 50}} and {{c|Unknown Soldier Vol 1 268}}. That was one busy bunker on April 30, 1945.

It knocks her unconscious and vanishes from the mortal plane with Etta in hand.  After Wonder Woman awakens, she becomes Diana Prince again and goes with Steve Trevor to investigate the Delphi Foundation, ostensibly run by the wheelchair-bound Oscar Pound.  Pound denies involvement with Etta's disappearance.  But later, he is visited by Klarion the Witch-Boy, who has given him back the use of his legs with witchcraft in return for the backing of his foundation.  Wonder Woman goes to consult with Mother Juju, who tells her about Jason Blood.  The Amazon visits Blood and his partner Randu, and speaks the incantation that allows Etrigan the Demon to take over Blood's body.  The Demon agrees to help her find Baal-Satyr, and they leave the mortal plane.

| Speaker             = [[Selina Kyle (New Earth)|Catwoman]]

| StoryTitle1         = Backward Masking, Conclusion
| Synopsis1           = 
[[Samuel Bradley, Jr. (New Earth)|Sam Bradley]] is in a hospital arguing with a doctor. He wants to go into the hospital room with [[Samuel Bradley (New Earth)|his father]], but she insists he stay outside and let the doctors do their work. 

The doctors are horrified to discover a message for [[Selina Kyle (New Earth)|Catwoman]] carved into Slam's abdomen: "Hi, CW! The fun is just beginning."

Selina and Sam drink coffee in her apartment, discussing Slam's condition and safety. Sam says his father is a tough man who can survive this, but Selina is more concerned that he only has a singular guard outside his room, the most his friends on the force can afford him. Sam thinks Selina is in greater danger for future attacks, pointing to the message found on Slam's stomach.

Selina is unworried. [[Roman Sionis (New Earth)|Black Mask]] has been gunning for her for years, and besides, it isn't like an increased police presence is the solution to her problem. Sam agrees. He's seen the police reports, he knows she can take care of herself. In fact, if he weren't facing a suspension, he'd be obliged to arrest her himself. Selina would like to see that.

Selina goes to get her mail and finds a letter with only "Selina" written for the address. Inside the envelope are photos of [[Holly Robinson (New Earth)|Holly]], some of them taken in Holly's own home. Selina runs to the deli where Holly and [[Karon (New Earth)|Karon]] are finishing up their meal. Selina is panicking, but Holly doesn't believe that anyone is out to kill her.

[[James Lenahan (New Earth)|Jim Lenahan]] tells Sam that no one blames him for going after his father when he was in trouble, but he did screw over the [[Gotham City Police Department]] when he went in there in the Smart Bomb armor. One of Black Mask's men sold the story to the tabloids, and now the entire department is in hot water, all the way to the top. Someone has to take the fall, and it's Sam--and it won't just be suspension, he'll probably serve time in prison.

Lenahan has never liked Sam. He assumed he was a tight-ass prig coasting by on his father's overinflated reputation. But Sam doesn't deserve to be screwed by the GCPD for this. Lenahan thinks he deserves a warning... and a head start.

Catwoman watches, perched on a gargoyle, as Holly and Karon eat takeout with a friend. She knows Black Mask is only waiting for the right time to strike. She needs help, but who? Neither Bruce nor Holly have taken her recent concerns seriously, and Slam is in a hospital bed. The only person she can turn to is Sam.

Sam is reluctant to join forces with Catwoman, and even then, he can't do much for her when he won't even be a cop this time tomorrow. But Catwoman isn't asking him as a cop. He takes one look at his unconscious father before asking Catwomen when and where.

Catwoman receives another phone call while still on her gargoyle perch. No one responds when she picks up. Instead part of her conversation with Sam is repeated back to her, and she knows it's Black Mask.

The next day, Selina and Sam meet at Burger Czar. Selina is the one with the plan. She's been living outside the law for years, dealing with supervillains without a badge to protect her. She knows what she's doing. Sam doesn't know what that plan is yet, but he'll be the one who executes it. Slam is his dad.

Lenahan is furious. He risked his neck to warn Sam about what's happening, and Sam repaid him by swiping the Smart Bomb armor out of lockup. But Lenahan and [[Carl Worth (New Earth)|Carl Worth]] are both drugged before they can stop him. Sam Bradley has an important meeting across town, and [[Angelo Bend (New Earth)|Angle Man]] is just covering all the angles.

Smart Bomb flies across the Gotham skyline as Catwoman watches, convinced that Sam made the right call in taking the suit. Then his jetpack malfunctions and he falls down, landing on a nearby building.

Catwoman is on her own. Which is fine, but there's one last thing she needs to do first: She goes to the hospital and hits Slam's police guard with a tranquilizer dart, knocking him out. She sits next to Slam and tells him everything that's happened. Then she says she's going to end Black Mask for good. She's learned a few things about herself that makes her think she can do it, and the only thing that can stop her now is if Slam wakes up and tells her not to. He doesn't wake.

Catwoman catches a ride on a GCPD blimp to Black Mask's apartment, and she enters with a gun brandished, walking towards where Black Mask is sitting, watching the TV. Only it's a false head on a stick, and Black Mask is really behind her with a tommy gun. She dodges the hail of gunfire, dropping her own pistol.

Black Mask says he's not going to kill Catwoman. He hasn't been living up to his potential as a Gotham-based villain, but now he will: He and Catwoman are going to be archenemies. Her friends will all die painfully, but she won't. She'll live a long, miserable life with him. How does that sound?

Catwoman kicks him, which starts another hail of gunfire. Black Mask assures her that he really isn't going to kill her. Everything in his apartment is replaceable except her. Catwoman disarms him and holds her own gun to his head, saying, "I'll kill you, I swear." Black Mask doubts that. He ''knows'' her.

Catwoman fires, killing him. No, he doesn't know her. Not anymore. Nobody does.

Catwoman is covered in blood and standing on the rooftop when a mystical force covers the entire place and the whole [[Infinite Crisis|universe starts changing]].

Fifteen years ago, [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Bruce Wayne]] is walking home from a movie with his father [[Thomas Wayne (Earth-Two)|Thomas Wayne]] and his [[Martha Wayne (Earth-Two)|mother]]. They are approached by a [[Joe Chill (Earth-Two)|mugger]] who tries to grab his mother's necklace. Thomas Wayne shouts for the mugger to leave her alone, and menaces him. The mugger shoots Thomas Wayne dead, saying that he asked for it. Bruce's mother is horrified and calls for the police. The mugger shoots and kills her also so she'll stop screaming. The young Bruce is horrified. Several days later, he kneels next to his bed by candlelight and makes a solemn vow. He swears by the spirit of his parents to avenge their deaths, by spending the rest of his life warring on all criminals. Years pass and Bruce Wayne prepares for this career. He becomes a master scientist, and trains his body to physical perfection. Finally, one night he is sitting in his father's mansion thinking about his future. His father's estate left him wealthy, but he needs a disguise. He knows that criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot, so his disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. He must become a black, terrible, creature of the night. Just then a huge bat flies through the open window, like an answer to his question. Bruce Wayne declares that this is an omen, and he shall become a bat. Thus was born this weird figure of the dark... this avenger of evil... '''The Batman'''.

| StoryTitle2         = The Joker
| Synopsis2           = [[Joker (Earth-Two)|The Joker]] announces on the radio that he will kill Henry Claridge and steal the Claridge diamond at midnight. A cordon of cops guard Claridge's home, but he dies anyway, at midnight with a grotesque smile on his face.  (He's been dosed, much earlier, with a delayed-action treatment of Joker Venom.) The police then discover that the diamond was already stolen, and that it was replaced with a glass one, and the Joker has left behind his calling card, a Joker.

Later the Joker goes on radio and announces that he will kill Jay Wilde and steal the Ronkers Ruby. Once again a cordon of police fails to safeguard the victim, who is killed at exactly midnight, with a poison dart, by the Joker, hiding in a suit of armor. The Joker deploys a paralyzing gas against the police, and departs with his loot.

But a mobster named Brute Nelson, who is enraged that the Joker is pulling off all these jobs that he had planned to do, sends word out that he thinks that the Joker is a coward. [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Bruce Wayne]] and [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Dick Grayson]] hear about this and suspect a trap. Batman goes to the mobster's house. The Joker is also there, and he shoots and kills Nelson, but he is pursued by Batman. However, the Joker gets the upper hand by knocking Batman off a bridge.

Luckily Batman survives&lt;!-- in some way --&gt;. The Joker then resumes his work by announcing that he will kill Judge Drake. The Joker impersonates the police chief, and kills the judge with Joker Venom, and leaves. Robin has been stationed outside, to follow whoever comes out, and he trails the killer to an abandoned house, where the Joker turns the tables on him and captures Robin.

The soles of Robin's shoes have been painted with an special chemical, and Batman used infra-red goggles to follow his trail, arriving just in time to save him from an injection of Joker Venom, and there's a big fight. The Joker sprays Batman with the same paralyzing gas that had taken out a whole squad of cops, but Batman just shakes it off, grabs Robin, and escapes. The Joker also manages to escape. Robin then tells Batman that the Joker was saying that he was going after the [[Cleopatra]] Necklace, owned by Otto Drexel. Batman and Robin arrive while the robbery is still in progress; the Joker uses all his ammunition shooting Batman in the chest; Batman has on a bulletproof vest; Joker loses and is sent to the State Penitentiary, although he vows to escape.

Batman then pilots the [[Batplane]] and kills many of Strange's henchman, and some of the monsters, with machine-gun fire. He also manages to hang one of the monsters with his [[Batrope]]. He finally kills the last monster by throwing tear gas pellets while it is atop a skyscraper, causing it to fall to its death.

| Synopsis4           = 
An elderly socialite, Mrs. Travers, is going on a yacht trip with several select friends and a $500,000 emerald necklace. Suspecting that some crook or other will try to steal it, Dick Grayson gets a job as a steward, as Batman has other business elsewhere. Soon, Dick has some suspects: Denny, Mrs. Travers' favorite nephew, who has borrowed lots of money from his aunt in the past (and brought an elderly guest, Miss Peggs, with him), Wallace, Mrs. Travers' doctor (who frequently borrows money to pay off gambling debts), and Mrs. Travers' brother Roger (who wants money to cover stock market losses).

Denny throws a piece of paper over the side of the yacht, but the wind blows it back to Dick. The letter is from [[Selina Kyle (Earth-Two)|The Cat]], asking Denny to keep Mrs. Travers away from her room. Suspecting the theft is about to take place, Dick hurries to the cabin, but Mrs. Travers has already discovered the theft. A boat claiming to be the Coast Guard approaches, but it is actually full of mobsters, after the necklace. The mobsters content themselves with stealing everything else, but when they go to shoot someone for protecting his wife, Dick barrels into them and gets knocked into the sea. He takes this chance to turn into Robin.

Meanwhile, the mobsters leave, satisfied with their takings. They race away, but Batman appears&lt;!-- how? from where? --&gt; and knocks them around. Robin has surfaced and joins in, with an object lesson. consisting of him versus four unarmed mobsters. The crooks quit (to stop Robin from hitting them any more), and Batman proves that, without their guns, crooks are cowards through and through.

They return to the yacht and Batman crashes a fancy dress party, to be awarded with the first prize. He returns the stolen loot and Robin sets off the fire alarm. This is a trap to persuade the Cat to reveal him/herself. Mrs. Peggs races off surprisingly well for someone with a bad ankle, but the Dynamic Duo still catch her. Batman pulls off her wig and removes her make-up to reveal a pretty girl. The necklace is hidden under her bandage. Denny tries to take the necklace, but Batman knocks him out. The Cat tries to persuade Batman to join her as King of Crime, but he refuses.

Then, despite leaving Denny on the yacht, Batman takes the Cat to the police himself. However, the Cat jumps over the side and Batman lets her escape. He's clearly smitten&lt;!-- , even though he still has a fiancée --&gt;.

| Synopsis5           = Two days after the [[Joker (Earth-Two)|Joker]] is captured, he manages to escape using explosive chemicals hidden in some false teeth, and begins to cause more trouble. At home, Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson hear the news on the radio and Bruce speculates that Joker is probably after vengeance. The Joker enters his secret laboratory through a hidden entrance in the graveyard, and starts plotting. He threatens Chief of Police Chalmers, and kills him a dart, released with a phone call.

The next day, a painting is stolen, and the owner of a stolen gem is found dead, grinning. Then the Joker threatens to steal the [[Cleopatra]] necklace. Bruce Wayne, hearing it on the radio, promises to stop him. That night, in the museum, the Joker emerges from a sarcophagus, and uses his poison to incapacitate the guards. Batman appears and disarms him. The Joker seizes an axe and knocks out Batman. The Police arrive, and find the unconscious Batman AND the missing necklace. Before the cops can remove Batman's cowl, he snaps awake and escapes out the window.

A reformer, Edgar Martin calls for the capture of the Joker, and is marked for death. That night, Martin is under guard and plays cards to calm down. But the pack is all jokers, and poison-laced, killing Martin.

The next day Bruce Wayne suggests a trap for the Joker to his friend Commissioner Gordon. The press prints a series of articles on the Fire Ruby, and despite suspecting a trap, the Joker goes for it. When he arrives, the police surround him, and he shoots, making for the roof. Robin, waiting for him, follows. Joker knocks him off the roof, but Robin grabs a flagpole to save himself. Running down to see if Robin has died, the Joker takes aim and is intercepted by Batman. Robin falls down and lands on the Joker. Batman and Joker fight, and Joker stabs himself in the chest. Batman and Robin flee, leaving the Police to find out that the Joker is still alive.

* This issue's Batman and Robin appearances take place after their appearances in {{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 38}} and in {{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 39}}, going by their on-sale dates. 
* James Gordon chronologically appeared previously in {{c|Batman Vol 1 32}}. He appears next in {{c|New York World's Fair Comics Vol 1 2}}.
* "The Legend of the Batman - Who He is, and How he Came to Be" was originally printed in {{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 33}}. The splash page introducing this story was reprinted from {{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 34}}. This story is also reprinted in {{c|Famous First Edition Vol 1 F-5}}, {{c|Millennium Edition: Batman Vol 1 1}}, {{co|Batman: From the 30's to the 70's (Collected)}}, {{co|Batman: The Dark Knight Archives Vol 1 (Collected)}} and {{co|Batman: A Celebration of 75 Years (Collected)}}.
===The Joker===
* This issue features the first appearance of the [[Joker (Earth-Two)|Joker]]. The Joker makes a chronologically earlier appearance as the [[Red Hood]] as revealed in a flashback in {{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 168}}. He appears next in {{c|Batman Vol 1 2}}.
* The Joker knocks Batman unconscious, with an axe. This is Batman's 5th blunt-instrument head trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 37}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The plot from "The Joker" is re-imagined in the [[2005]] graphic novel {{c|Batman: The Man Who Laughs}}. The plots from "The Joker" and "The Joker Returns" are also a major influence on the 2008 feature film ''[[The Dark Knight (Movie)|The Dark Knight]]'' where the Joker does the same things as he did in that comic, such as publicly announcing his crimes before committing them, removing his make-up and disguising himself as a police officer to gain access to a person he had threatened to kill, using a powerful bomb smuggled into jail to escape, stealing and killing not for personal gain but to simply create chaos and disorder, and infringing upon the city's old-fashioned mobsters.
* The plot from "The Joker" can also be revisited at [[Crack Comics Vol 1 4#Synopsis for The Clock: .22The Asp.22|Crack Comics #4 Aug 1940]] and [[Smash Comics Vol 1 25#Synopsis for Bozo the Robot: .22The Clown.22|Smash Comics #25 Aug 1941]].

===Hugo Strange===
* [[Hugo Strange]] appeared last in {{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 36}}. He appears next in {{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 46}}.
* Batman straight up kills many of Strange's monsters, with machine-gun fire. He also hangs one. He also tear-gases one into falling off a tall building. This may have been [[Retcon|retconned out]] of [[Earth-Two]] history. It is never mentioned again. 
* The asylum featured in "The Giants of Hugo Strange" is never identified, however it seems to exist as an [[Earth-Two]] counterpart to the famous [[Arkham Asylum]] of [[Earth-One|Earths One]] and [[New Earth|New]].
* "The Giants of Hugo Strange" is also known as "''Professor Hugo Strange and the Monsters''".
* Robin is absent from this story. It will be many years before his next absence, in [[1969]].
**This is due to this story taking place before Robin was introduced; it was advertised at the end of "[[Detective Comics Vol 1 37|The Screaming House]]", but was released out of order.
* "''The Giants of Hugo Strange''" is reprinted in:
** {{co|The Greatest Batman Stories Ever Told (Collected)}}
** {{co|Batman: The Greatest Stories Ever Told Vol. 2 (Collected)}}

** {{c|Millennium Edition: Batman Vol 1 1}}
** {{co|Batman Chronicles Vol 1 (Collected)}}
** {{co|Batman: The Dark Knight Archives Vol 1 (Collected)}}.
* "The Giants of Hugo Strange" takes place on [[Earth-Two]], but according to {{c|Detective Comics Vol 1 471}}, similar events also occurred early in [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-One)|Batman's]] career on [[Earth-One]].
===The Cat===
* This issue is the first appearance of [[Selina Kyle (Earth-Two)|Catwoman]]. She makes a chronologically earlier appearance in flashback, in {{c|Batman Vol 1 62}}, and in {{c|The Brave and the Bold Vol 1 197}}. She appears next in {{c|Batman Vol 1 2}}.
* The [[Selina Kyle (Earth-Two)|Catwoman]] is referred to only as the ''Cat'' in this issue.
* Batman breaks the [[Fourth Wall]], directly addressing the reader: "Well kids, there's your proof! Crooks are ''yellow'' without their guns! Don't go around admiring them--rather do your best in fighting them and all their kind!"
* "The Cat" is reprinted in:

He interferes and the thug is driven away, but the other man, Dr. Craig, has a little scratch on his hand. Batman and [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Robin]] start investigating and find out something is wrong, so they go to Dr. Craigs house, where they find him hypnotized and handing over a secret formula to the thugs. Batman defeats the thugs and Dr. Craig comes to his senses.

| Synopsis2           = 
Batman saves Detective McGonigle from a gang that was attacking him and after they are gone, McGonigle tries to capture Batman, to no avail.

The next day, Bruce Wayne meets with Harry Dodge and Larry Larrimore for a business. However, Dodge's face starts changing abruptly and soon his face is hideously disfigured. After a doctor checks him, he can't find a reasonable explanation and soon, many people in the city start changing in the same way.

Elsewhere in the city, a large group of people with ugly, disfigured faces are gathered, expecting their leader, the ugliest man in the world. When he appears, he commands them to bring destruction to everything that is considered beautiful as vengeance against society.

Knowing about a precious art piece in the city, Batman and Robin soon go to stop the ugly horde from destroying it at the pier. The duo manage to overcome almost all their enemies and before Batman can be attacked from behind, Detective McGonigle saves Batman. McGonigle tries to capture the duo, but he is fooled again.

Batman and Robin learn that a man named Ekhart has found a cure for the face deformities and they rush to the place, knowing that his life might be in danger. When they arrive, they stop the ugly men from attacking Ekhart and when they try to escape, Batman follows them on his car.

Batman arrives at the secret lair of the ugly men, but he is outnumbered and captured. They take Batman to a basement, where they tie him next to other prisoners and the leader appears: it was Larry Larrimore all along! Taking of his mask, he reveals his true identity as Carlson, the ugliest man in the world. He explains that he caused the face deformations as a way of getting revenge for a past tragedy that caused him to lose his once handsome face and ruined his life.

Meanwhile, knowing that Batman might be in danger, Robin starts following the trail of the Batmobile and finds the secret lair of the ugly men. Robin breaks in, rescues Batman and the duo stop the horde from terrorizing the city. Carlson tries to stab Batman, but he is shot from behind by Detective McGonigle, who once again tries to capture Batman and is yet again fooled.

With Carlson dead, Ekhart is able to deliver his cure and the ugly people's faces change back to normal.

| Synopsis3           = 
Batman spots some criminals on a rooftop and a hot chase begins. Batman manages to catch up with them and he knocks them all out until there's only one man left. However, when Batman realizes that the last thug is in fact a boy, he lets him go and follows him to a warehouse where he learns that a school for criminals is operating there.

Batman gets the idea of building a gym near the warehouse to get the youngsters into sports and fair play. With some help from Dick Grayson, the kids of the crime school start practicing sports and fair play. However, they are still going to the crime school and Batman sends Dick as an undercover agent. Dick informs about the next hit of the gang and Batman foils the criminals' plan.

Back at the school, the mastermind behind  the school believes that the main teacher has ratted them out to Batman and kills him. Batman arrives and fights the big man in front of the kids, who start admiring Batman instead of the criminals. With help from the kids, Batman manages to defeat the leader and his gang and the kids start living a straight life.

| Synopsis4           = 
{{Image|Catwoman (Earth-Two) 001.jpg|The Cat-Woman|right}}A new criminal has appeared in the city and she is [[Selina Kyle (Earth-Two)|Cat-Woman]]. Now, wearing a cat mask, she steals some of the most valuable gems from the city's wealthy people and the police are baffled by her amazing feats. [[James Gordon (Earth-Two)|Commissioner Gordon]] demands that she is captured and for that purpose, he assigns Detective McGonigle to the case.

Meanwhile, Batman goes out on his daily patrol and he witness a murder on the streets. He fights the attackers away from the victim and he tries to get the dying man to talk the reason why he was attacked. After Batman learns of the Diamond Sindicate, one of the thugs knocks him unconscious and Batman is saved by the timely arrival of Detective McGonigle, who proceeds to handcuff Batman while he is unconscious. However, upon waking up, Batman knocks the detective unconscious and he escapes.

The next day, Bruce Wayne goes to see his friend James Gordon and together they go to investigate the murder of the man at the Diamond Sindicate Headquarters. The members of this organization are baffled to know about last night's murder and they inform Gordon that they fear something will happen at the jewels exposing gala that night. The ceremony was organized by the sindicate to showcase their best jewels worn by models and Gordon takes action.

That night, Bruce Wayne attends at the gala and he witness how one of the models throws a blinding powder to the audience and escapes with the jewels. The model turns out to be Cat-Woman, but on her way out of the building, she is abducted by some gangsters and placed inside a car. As the car takes her and the jewels away, Robin follows them on his small roadster.

Meanwhile, Bruce changes into Batman and goes to the home of one of the Diamond Sindicate's members and he is surprised to be attacked by the man. Batman knocks him unconscious and after a brief update of events with Robin, Batman takes the man to he Sindicate's main headquarters, where the other members have kidnapped Cat-woman and finally the ultimate plot is revealed. The second member of the Sindicare hired Catwoman's services as a thief to steal some of the jewels as well as the man who was killed the night before and the ultimate goal was to take away all the revenue for himself. However, when he realized that Catwoman and others involved would take a piece of his take, he decided to eliminate them all and be the sole owner of the Diamond Sindicate. Batman and Robin fight off all the gangsters and soon they are all captured. When Batman rescues Catwoman, he tells her that she is going to jail as well, but with a grateful kiss, Catwoman distracts Batman long enough to make her escape effective and but Batman doesn't seem bothered by that.

Later, Batman delivers the stolen jewels to Detective McGonigel, who is still sour because Batman keeps escaping from him.

Elsewhere, Catwoman drives a car away from the city, wishing that Batman was with her.

| Synopsis1           = 
The Joker has miraculously survived his apparent death-by-knife-wound (*1), during his last encounter with Batman in [[Batman Vol 1 1|Batman #1]]. He is taken to a hospital, wounded almost to death.   Batman briefly plans to abduct the Joker and take him to a famous specialist who can fix his brain, but instead, Crime Syndicate, Inc., a criminal gang in need of a leader, and a better brand-name, kidnap him from the hospital, hoping to obtain his help in stealing the priceless Pharaoh Gems. First they force some doctors, at gunpoint, to operate on the Joker, which draws Commissioner Gordon and a whole lot of cops to cordon off the building, but the gangsters (led by "Weasel") lure the police away by having a Batman impersonator attack them.  The impersonator kills two cops and leads many of the rest away in pursuit; after a battle at a barn, the bogus Batman is shot dead and unmasked as "Circus Charlie," a wanted criminal.  &lt;br/&gt; ---  The Joker is brought back to health, and sets about double-crossing his saviors right away.   Meanwhile the real Batman, and Robin, arrive at the hospital and find the [[Catwoman]] outside. She also has a plan to steal some jewels, but gives Batman some information about the Joker, and he lets her go free, without telling her that the floor of his 1939 Cord (*2) is coated with a radioactive material which she now has on her feet.  Batman equips Robin with a special flashlight and sends him to track the Cat's movements, then he personally busts up the Crime Syndicate.  &lt;br/&gt; ---  The Catwoman visits the owner of the Pharaoh gem (E.S. Arthur), who lives in a castle with a tower, but she finds Arthur murdered by the Joker (*3), who is still there, and who sticks her up. Robin swoops in, another fight ensues. Joker manages to knock Robin out. The Catwoman trades the Pharaoh to the Joker in exchange for sparing Robin's life. Batman soon comes and has a sword fight with the Joker, who wins and knocks Batman out the window. The Joker then tries to kill Robin and Catwoman with flaming arrows, and sets the tower on fire in the process. Suddenly Batman arrives and he battles the Joker before knocking him out. Batman is forced to leave the Joker behind in the burning building in order to carry Robin into the Batplane.  Catwoman evades Batman once again by leaping from the Batplane into the water below.
*1 The [[Joker (Earth-Two)|Joker]] appeared last in [[Batman Vol 1 1|Batman #1]]. He appears next in [[Detective Comics Vol 1 45|Detective Comics #45]].  This is his third appearance.
*2 Batman drives a powerful, expensive car, but has not yet built his first Batmobile.
*3 Joker's Body Count = 16.
| Synopsis2           = Adam Lamb is a museum curator for Cyrus Craig's private museum.  One night, while Lamb is making his rounds, he trips on a rug and strikes his head on the ground.  Dazed he glances at a bat portrait and his mystery novel "The Crime Master" while a clock chimes midnight.  After a few hours he wakes up and heads home.  The next night when the clock strikes midnight, his personality changes to that of Wolf, violent master criminal.  Every night after, he commits crimes until he attracts the attention of [[Batman]] and [[Robin]].  One day Craig is showing [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]] around the museum.  After another encounter with the crime master, he remembers Lamb's car looks like that of his alter-ego Wolf.  Bruce decides to visit the museum.  That night at the museum Lamb turns into Wolf while helping Craig and tries to kill him.  
Batman and Robin jump in and save Craig. Lamb becomes confused when he notices Batman's emblem.  Batman and Robin follow the Crime Master's car to the waterfront, where they attack his gang. &lt;u&gt;Batman is shot in the shoulder&lt;/u&gt;(*1), and the Dynamic Duo use a smoke pellet to cover their trail and escape back to Bruce's laboratory, where it falls upon young Dick to surgically remove the slug from Bruce's shoulder.(*2)  In their next encounter, Lamb is accidentally killed when Batman knocks him down the stairs (*3).  Before his death he recalls, to Batman, Robin, and Craig what caused his transformations.  
*1 This is Batman bullet-wound #3.
*2 There is no Bat-Cave yet, and no Alfred.
*3 Batman punches Lamb, and THAT is how he falls down the stairs and breaks his neck, so technically Batman killed this guy.  Bat-body-count &lt;u&gt;&gt;&lt;/u&gt; 23.

| Synopsis3           = The story begins with Clubfoot (a large clubfooted man with a hook for a hand) murdering Harley Storme.  [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Batman]] attempts to catch Clubfoot only to be dazed by a kick to the face.  The next day Bruce Wayne and [[James Gordon (Earth-Two)|Commissioner Gordon]] go to the Storme Mansion.  While they are there they find that the whole Storme Family hates one another and have only come together for Harley Storme's Will, read by Ward the lawyer.  The family is only given envelopes with a piece of gold with the inscription "United we stand, Divided we fall."   The family is annoyed, but Ward tells them all will be explained if they attend another meeting in 30 days at which time he will open a sealed letter from Haley.  Later Tommy Storme tells his loan shark Varrick that Ward will read a letter at the end of the month, Varrick decides to pay Ward a visit the next day.  That night Clubfoot kills Abel Storme in his sleep.  The next day, after hearing the news of Abel Storme's death, Bruce decides to visit Ward.  Upon arrival Batman is met by Varrick's men, who are quickly dispatched, at an abandoned powerhouse by the waterfront. The next night Robin searches the Storme mansion only to find Roger Storme dead.  He is then ambushed by Clubfoot.  Clubfoot is fought off and decides to make his escape.  Meanwhile Batman is at Ward's home when he discovers the real Clubfoot Beggs.  Beggs tells Batman how he was kidnapped and framed by Ward.  Ward just arriving from his encounter with Robin, draws a gun on Batman.  Ward tells how the scratchings on the tokens spelled gold mine when fully assembled, and that the gold mine was left to Harley's heirs.  Since Ward was an heir he decided to kill the Storme family and take the mine for himself.  At this time Robin burst into the scene and knocked the gun from Ward's hand.  Ward makes a break for the stairs and is stopped by Batman and taken to jail.
| Synopsis4           = Batman leaps on to a train heading to Gotham and is attacked by some African pygmies.  After fighting his way to Professor Drake's train car he finds that the pygmies are after a 15-foot-tall, white caveman called Goliath, whom Drake has captured and brought to the U.S. from Africa. Professor Drake claims that Goliath is a missing link, and plans to civilize him.  The news of Goliath spreads rapidly.  When Hackett and Sneed, owners of the circus, hear of Goliath, they put on tuxedos and approach Drake with an offer. If Goliath were put in their circus, all three men could profit. Drake becomes outraged by this proposal and has them thrown out.  Batman appears again that night to talk to Drake.  He tells Drake that Hackett and Sneed will do anything to get their hands on Goliath.  Later that night a man named Grimes shoots the Professor and makes it appear to be a suicide.  While patrolling Professor Drakes house Robin hears the gunshot.  He arrives as Grimes and his men are leaving.  While they are fighting Goliath breaks free and chases Grimes away, looking at Grimes's face as he leaves.  Goliath walks back to Drake's office and finds Drake dead.  A note was forged saying he would be given to Hackett and Sneed's circus.  At the circus that night Goliath sees Grimes sitting in the audience and goes berserk.  Goliath kills Grimes, but continues his rampage, setting loose the animals.  Batman and Robin jump into the scene and wrangle all the animals.  Goliath spots Robin and hurls him away toward the trapeze in anger.  Robin escapes death, but Goliath goes after Robin in his fury and climbs up to the trapeze.  Batman rushes to help Robin and ties up Goliath with his rope.  Robin then takes his sling and knocks Goliath dizzy.  Sadly, this causes Goliath to fall from the trapeze pole and takes Batman with him.  Batman saves himself with the trapeze rope, but Goliath falls to his death.  Hackett and Sneed are arrested for murder. Batman and Robin discuss what has befallen. 
* Robin's body count = 4.

| Synopsis1           = A gunman who was formerly employed by [[John Deleon (New Earth)|John Deleon]], to whom [[Oliver Queen (New Earth)|Oliver Queen]] lost his fortune, holds a woman hostage at gunpoint aboard the deck of a ship. Green Arrow opposes him, seeking the briefcase full of evidence of Deleon's wrongdoings the gunman carries, but the terrorist insists on Green Arrow leaping overboard in return for his releasing the woman. Green Arrow remembers his origin story, how Oliver Queen once fell off another ship, swam to [[Starfish Island]], learned the use of a makeshift bow, and used it to help defeat a band of pirates who landed on his isle. Green Arrow then manages to take out the gunman, though the briefcase is lost in the sea. He decides that the papers within it don't have much meaning to him anymore.

| Synopsis3           =On Earth-Two, Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle married back in the 50's, and the two had a daughter, Helena. After the birth of his daughter the Batman of Earth-Two retired, and Robin took up his mantle. Many years have passed and Helena has grown up to be a beautiful and strong woman, with both her parents seemingly having escaped their past. One day an old henchman of the Catwoman blackmails Selina with a photograph that shows her killing a police officer. She is forced to dress up as Catwoman and help the crook do a robbery, but Commissioner Gordon gets wise of the crime and lights the Bat signal. Only Bruce sees the signal, as Robin is out of the country and decides to deal with it himself. Batman quickly arrives at the scene, but dismays when he sees Selina there, in the ensuing fight the crook's stray bullet kills Selina, with her last words an apology, meanwhile the Batman can just stand there. During the funeral, Helena swears vengeance on the criminals who caused her mother's demise and fashions a costume for herself together with a collapsible crossbow. She tracks down the killer and learns that it was a doctored photo all along. He leaves him trussed up before the police headquarters, with Bruce wondering why Robin hasn't announced that he was back in town…

| StoryTitle1         = Divine Intervention
| Synopsis1           = As a battle rages in the seas between the heroes of Atlantis and their enemies, [[Aztar (New Earth)|the Spectre]] emerges in destructive fury against both friend and foe. The battle between the Amazons on Paradise Island and the [[Omni Mind and Community|OMACs]] does not go well as their forces are totally overwhelmed, with [[Diana of Themyscira (New Earth)|Wonder Woman]] making the hard choice that the Amazons must leave this realm of existence by the protection of the gods. The gathered heroes at [[New Cronus]] arrive at the center of the universe where they deal with a powerful maelstrom as well as the warring [[Thanagarians|Thanagarian]] and [[Rannians|Rannian]] ships in that vicinity. [[Kal-El (New Earth)|Superman]] comes to the help of the [[Shadowpact (New Earth)|Shadowpact]] in El Paso, Texas while [[Jaime Reyes (New Earth)|Jaime Reyes]] finds the [[Khaji Da (New Earth)|Blue Beetle Scarab]]. [[Wally West (New Earth)|Wally West]] rushes off as the Flash to deal with a super-tornado in Kansas City.

[[Bruce Wayne (New Earth)|Batman]] is frustrated at his inability to stop [[Brother Eye]] from carrying out Program Truth And Justice when [[Kal-L (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Superman]] visits him, telling Batman that [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|the Dark Knight]] he knew on [[Earth-Two]] was a man that lived past the death of his parents, allowing himself to love, [[Selina Kyle (Earth-Two)|to marry]], and have [[Helena Wayne (Earth-Two)|a child]]. Kal-L tries to reason with Batman that the best course of action is to allow his own reality to be replaced with that of Earth-Two, which he believed held more promise than the one Batman knew. Unfortunately, Batman questioned whether that reality's [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Dick Grayson]] was a better version of his own's, and so attempted to use Lex Luthor's [[Kryptonite Ring]] on Kal-L to no effect, only for Kal-L to burn it off Batman's finger with his heat vision.

[[Alexander Luthor (New Earth)|Lex Luthor]] discovers his [[Alexander Luthor, Jr. (Earth-Three)|doppelganger's]] hideout and confronts him, only to be overpowered by both his opponent's intellect and his power. Fortunately, Lex Luthor manages to destroy a computer in the hideout, exposing the doppleganger as Alexander Luthor using a holographic projection over himself. Then [[Kal-El (Earth-Prime)|Superboy-Prime]] sneaks up from behind and rips Lex Luthor's battlesuit off him, then is ordered by Alexander Luthor to dispose of him. However, Lex Luthor teleports himself away before Superboy's heat vision touches him.

[[Kara Zor-L (Earth-Two)|Power Girl]] takes some time away from visiting [[Lois Lane (Earth-Two)|Lois Lane-Kent]] to think of whether she would be willing to help restore the reality that Kal-L and his wife once knew and reenters the hideout with her answer when she notices a giant machine with part of the [[Anti-Monitor (Antimatter Universe)|Anti-Monitor's corpse]] attached to it. She notices that several superheroes are also attached to the machine, unconscious, which included the [[J'onn J'onzz (New Earth)|Martian Manhunter]], who was last seen at the JLA Watchtower on the moon. Power Girl flies up to where J'onn J'onnz is located and asks if he is okay when she is attacked from behind. It is Superboy-Prime and Alexander Luthor who did this, with Superboy-Prime saying that he knew she would never help them and Alexander saying that she will help them whether she wants to or not.

In the Batcave, Batman plays back what his "black box" has recorded about the intruder posing as Superman who has infiltrated the Watchtower, destroyed it, and made off with Martian Manhunter. The evidence reveals that it was Superboy-Prime who did it.

[[Ian Karkull (New Earth)|Ian Karkull]] was an enemy of Doctor Fate, who was presumed dead. Karkull was not dead however, but fled to the Dark Dimension worshiped by the denizens of Ragnor known as the [[Shadowlands]]. The priests of Ragnor sacrificed the shadows of their victims to the forces of the Shadowlands and Karkull collected these shadows to empower himself. In 1941, he used the arcane forces in the Shadowlands to learn the names of future presidents of the United States and dispatched a strike force of super-villains to murder them (The villains: [[Alexander the Great (Earth-Two)|Alexander the Great]], [[Selina Kyle (Earth-Two)|Catwoman (Selina Kyle)]], [[Doctor Doog (New Earth)|Doctor Doog]], [[Ian Karkull (New Earth)|Ian Karkull]], [[Lightning Master (Earth-Two)|Lightning Master]], [[Sieur Satan (New Earth)|Sieur Satan]], [[Crossart (Earth-Two)|Tarantula]], [[Wotan (New Earth)|Wotan]] and [[Zachary Zor (New Earth)|Zor]]). This effort was opposed by the [[Justice Society of America (New Earth)|Justice Society]], which thwarted each of the villains except for Karkull's ally, [[Wotan]]. (What effect the murder of Wotan's victim had were never revealed.) Tracking the trails of the emissary villains, the JSA confronted Karkull, blasting him with their combined powers. The forces exceeded Karkull's ability to contain the ancient shadows, which then exploded out of him, seemingly tearing him apart.  The radiation of the shadows' departure bathed the assembled heroes, apparently extending their lives and affecting them in other, unknown ways.

The people affected included Justice Society members [[Albert Pratt (New Earth)|Atom (Al Pratt)]], [[Kent Nelson (New Earth)|Doctor Fate (Kent Nelson)]], [[Jason Garrick (New Earth)|Flash (Jay Garrick)]], [[Alan Scott (New Earth)|Green Lantern (Alan Scott)]], [[Hawkman]], [[Rex Tyler (New Earth)|Hourman (Rex Tyler)]], [[Johnny Thunder]], [[Wesley Dodds (New Earth)|Sandman (Wesley Dodds)]], [[James Corrigan (New Earth)|Spectre (Jim Corrigan)]], and non-members [[Theodore Knight (New Earth)|Starman (Ted Knight)]], [[Hawkgirl]] and [[Joan Williams (New Earth)|Joan Williams]]. The radiation vastly extended their lifespans.

| Notes               = 
* Final Annual for the series.
* Includes a four-page preview for the ''[[Jemm, Son of Saturn Vol 1|Jemm, Son of Saturn]]'' limited series.
===Pre-Crisis Story===
* The framing sequence of this story takes place in '''Late February, 1942'''. The flashback takes place on '''June 28-29, 1941''', immediately following the events depicted in [[All-Star_Comics_Vol_1_7#Synopsis_for_.22.241.2C000.2C000_for_War_Orphans.22|All-Star Comics #7]], where each JSA member raised $100,000 for war orphans. 
** Superman finally reveals where he got $100,000, more than 40 years after the publication of All-Star Comics # 7: He took some coals from a coalyard and turned them into diamond. Batman obviously used some of his vast wealth; Flash simply states "this is a story for later".
* Most of Ian Karkull's underling villains were already dead in their own timelines, to which they seemingly returned at the end of this story.  This implies, but never states, that Ian Karkull's henchvillain-recruiting technique was the same one used by Per Degaton, in the [[All-Star_Squadron_Vol_1_1#Notes|first]] through [[All-Star_Squadron_Vol_1_4|fourth]] issues of All-Star Squadron.
* Wotan's powers of science and magic are vast, plus more importantly, ill-defined.  By late June 1941, Wotan (4th scheme, 2nd team-up w/ Karkull) had already escaped Hades, escaped the earth's core, and "seemingly perished" in one fire.  Also he packed a ray-gun whose crimson rays negated GL's green flame.  Of Karkull's eight hench-super-villains, Wotan is the only one who accomplished his assigned assassination.  
* Zor's powers of magic are also vast, and also ill-defined.   By late June 1941, Zor (3rd scheme) had already 1/ escaped paralysis in a distant dimension and 2/ escaped paralysis encoffined in ectobane in the far-flung depths of the universe. "Once he had been stronger than The Spectre, but the tables had long since turned."  The chronicles are unclear as to what exact steps The Spectre took in June 1941 to neutralize the threat of Zor, but it is clear that they were effective.
* According to Green Lantern, Dr. Fate's most recent victory over Karkull &amp; Wotan (in [[More Fun Comics Vol 1 78|More Fun Comics #70, Aug 1941]]) had been "last year."  Therefore the Dr. Fate stories in More Fun #s 58 ~ 70 all need to have happened during 1940, at an average of about three per month.
* Ian Karkull much later returned to menace the JSA, in 1999, after a very long convalescence.  
* Catwoman (named only as "The Cat" here) wears her literal cat mask, the same as in [[Batman Vol 1 3]]. 
* When Catwoman invades the Warner Bros. Studios, Ronald Reagan is performing in the filming of ''{{WP|Kings Row}}'', which most film critics considered his best movie.
* At this story's end: 
** Dr. Fate starts to realize that Nabu is taking control of him whenever he dons the Helm of Nabu. 
** Hourman starts to reassess his dependency on Miraclo, and leaves the JSA to refine his Miraclo formula. 
** Green Lantern, shaken by his failure against Wotan, opts for honorary membership, naming Hawkman the new chairman.  
** Soon-to-be new member Starman is put in touch with the JSA; their other new member, Doctor Mid-Nite, meets them at the beginning of {{c|All-Star Comics Vol 1 8}}.

===Post-Crisis Notes===
* Various Post-Crisis stories (including {{c|Green Lantern Corps Quarterly Vol 1 1}} and {{c|JSA Vol 1 7}}&amp;ndash;{{c|JSA Vol 1 9|#9}}) have referenced this story, establishing that it still happened post-Crisis, and that exposure to the exploding Ian Karkull's "chronal energies" was the reason why many JSA members were physically vital well into their later years. However, this story couldn't have happened exactly as first presented, post-Crisis, as some of the story elements (including the characters Earth-Two Batman, Robin, and Catwoman) no longer existed in that era.
** In the Superman-less 1941 of New Earth, it is an open question whether Ian Karkull would include [[Lightning Master (Earth-Two)|Lightning Master]] in his plan, or if Lightning Master even existed.
** In the Batman-less, Robin-less, and Catwoman-less 1941 of New Earth, the events of this story would be very different.
** In New Earth continuity, Ian Karkull's counterpart to the JSA's Sandman might have been Mr. Crossart the Tarantula (first seen on Earth-Two in June 1939) or Roger Goldman the Tarantula (first seen on New Earth in Jan or Feb 1938).

===Future History Notes===
* Age/occupation/location of the future presidents at the time of the story, and their designated would-be-killers: 
**33rd President, Harry S. Truman: age 57, senator, Army-Navy Hospital at Hot Springs, Arkansas (but referred to as "Georgia" at page 9), Lightning Master;  
**34th President, Dwight D. Eisenhower: age 51, he was a colonel at Fort Lewis, Washington, and the designated killer was Sieur Satan; 
**35th President, John F. Kennedy: age 24, writer&lt;ref&gt;In early 1941, Kennedy left Stanford Graduate School of Business and helped his father write a memoir of his three years as an American ambassador. See {{WP|John F. Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;, New England, Tarantula; 
**36th President, Lyndon Johnson: age 33, congressman, Texas, Alexander the Great;
**37th President, Richard Nixon: age 28, lawyer, he was on a Caribbean cruise trip, Ian Karkull. 
**38th President, Gerald Ford: 28, he opened a law practice on Grand Rapids, Michigan, Zor;
**39th President, James Carter: age 17, student in Plains, Georgia, Dr. Doog;
**40th President, Ronald Reagan: age 30, actor at Warner Bros. Studios in Hollywood, Catwoman;
**41st President:
*** In the original [[Earth-Two]] context of this story, the future president killed by Wotan was probably ''not'' [[George H. W. Bush (New Earth)|George H. W. Bush]], who was born in 1924 and was 17 years old at the time of this story.  The boy killed in the story looked much younger than that.
**** It is possible that Karkull succeeded in eliminating the "''rightful''" 41st President, and arranged for him to be replaced by a president of his own choosing (who in turn might or might not have been G.H.W. Bush).
**** It is not possible, from the existing evidence, at this late date, to discern the goals of Ian Karkull's scheme.  One reason for this is that Karkull was insane.  His plan, in 1941, was to alter the future history of the presidency of the United States, for some unstated purpose.

'''Chapter One: The Sleep of Reason'''

In the middle of the night, [[Bruce Wayne (New Earth)|Bruce Wayne]] wakes up after having a nightmare about the night that his parents died, but in the dream, Batman was holding the gun. Alone in his room, Bruce notices the [[Bat-Signal]] in the sky and goes to meet [[James Gordon (New Earth)|Commissioner Gordon]]. Together, they head to the morgue where Gordon shows Batman what was left of a body they foundas only a mass of skin and muscles without any shape because all the bones in the body had been crushed. Gordon takes Batman to the place where they found the body and they realize that there was a hole in a wall, but there weren't bricks or rubble around, which led Batman to the obvious answer that someone crushed the wall in the same way as the bones of the victim were crushed. After that, Batman returns home, tries to sleep for a while but the nightmare continues and he decides to work on the mystery down in the [[Batcave]].

That day, a woman named Jeannie Bowen arrives at [[Gotham City]], looking for his long lost brother. She is staying in a modest hotel and the next day, she goes to the last place her brother was seen: [[Wayne Enterprises]]. She waits for the personnel manager, but after a while she asks help from Riordan, the director of research at WayneTech, who tells her that her brother never worked in Wayne Enterprises, tearing all her hopes apart.

That night, Batman goes to pier 38, to stop a drug dealing racket. The vigilante patiently waits until the criminals complete their transaction, but before they could do it, they are attacked by a big man, wearing a white hood and some artifacts on his wrists. The man crushed the cargo ships were the drugs were being transported and then, he attacks the criminals, until the timely intervention of Batman. They fight and Batman manages to hurt the man that calls himself ''Bonecrusher'', who tries to escape with his open wound bleeding profusely. Batman tracks Bonecrusher to the rooftop of a warehouse, where he tries to take the man to the police, but Bonecrusher jumps to the high voltage lines and kills himself, preventing any further recognition. When Gordon and the police arrive at the scene, Batman explains that because of the headache he was feeling before Bonecrusher appears, the man was using some ultrasonic gadgets that allowed him to pulverize solid objects by using different frequencies of sound called ''ultrasound'' and ''infrasound'', and thus making him the responsible from last night's murder.

Elsewhere in Gotham, a homeless man tells his friends about a dream he had where he fought against Batman on the docks and he was a big man.

'''Chapter Two: The Kindness of Strangers'''

Some days later, Jeannie Bowen looks for help in a private corporation that contacted her to Bruce Wayne. Bruce can relate to Jeannie's story as they both are orphans with no one else in the world and decides to help her. Bruce takes her on a tour through Wayne Enterprises and after a while, they meet with an old man in a wheelchair called Kenneth Harbinger. Bruce explains him that Jeannie is looking for her brother and they show Kenneth a picture of the lost man, which Kenneth actually remembers as a young intern who used to work at WayneTech but disappeared six months ago. Riordan, the man who told Jeannie that her brother never worked in WayneTech, learns about their discovery and he report the news to someone and demands a plan of action.

Jeannie is so happy of making progress that she invites Bruce to the opera that night. As they are driving to the opera, Bruce notices the Bat-Signal and apologizes with Jeannie, leaves her on the road and goes to meet with Gordon, because the Bonecrusher was spotted again.

At that moment, the homeless man is attacked by thieves and before they could hurt him further, his friends rescue him and take him to a soup kitchen to recover.

The S.W.A.T. Team that had surrounded Bonecrusher are attacked with a high pitch noise sound created by Bonecrusher. Batman arrives at the scene and confronts Bonecrusher. At the same time, the homeless man starts replicating Bonecrusher's movements and actions at the soup kitchen. Batman uses a smoke pellet to distract Bonecrusher until the police surrounds him again. Bonecrusher decides to sacrifice himself instead of turning in and detonates a bomb near the flammable truck behind him. Before dying, his last words were ''"I am the scheme"''. At that moment, the police arrive at the soup kitchen and controls the homeless man, placing him under arrest. One of the officers who arrested him uses the radio to tell Gordon about the situation and also tells them about the man's last words before being subdued were "I am the scheme".

Batman visits the homeless man at prison and at first sight he remembers him as Roy Kane, Jeannie's brother. Apparently the man has lost all the memories he had and Batman requests Gordon to set the man free. The next day, Bruce and Jeannie go to meet with Roy, who was left with one of the best doctors in Gotham. Jeannie is happy to be reunited with her brother, despite the fact that he doesn't remember her. The doctor explains Bruce that there is some sort of biochip on Roy's head, similar to the technology that WayneTech has been developing. As a way of repaying them for all their troubles, Bruce offers Roy and Jeannie to stay at [[Wayne Manor]]. During their stay, Bruce asks Roy to remember anything about WayneTech, but the only thing that Roy remembers is the word "Sunday". At night, Bruce investigates the WayneTech files in the Batcave, looking for the word Sunday, but the only thing close to it is a project file named "Sabbat". Bruce tries to enter the file, but is somehow prevented from doing it, and at WayneTech, Riordan calls to the same person as he did earlier and informs him about Bruce's latest action.

'''Chapter Three: The Price of Knowledge'''

On a quiet day at Wayne Manor, Jeannie and Roy are talking about their future, when suddenly Roy starts to shake violently and the security alarm is triggered. [[Alfred Pennyworth (New Earth)|Alfred]] informs Bruce that there is a breach on their security and that someone is already inside the house. Roy starts posing in a weird way in front of a wall and with an explosion that tears the wall down, Bonecrusher comes inside the house in the same pose as Roy is. Bronecrusher realizes that Roy is intercepting his transmissions and thus, he replicates every movement that Bonecrusher does and that it must be why Bruce discovered about the Sabbat project. Bonecrusher attacks Roy and knocks him down, before focusing his attention in Bruce. However, Alfred strike from behind with a tranquilizer dart and Bonecrusher falls down, allowing Bruce to approach him and try to reveal the man behind the hood, but before Bruce could do it, the body explodes. When Roy recovers, he remembers something from WayneTech and the word Sabbat; it is an acronym for ''"surgically augmented biochip-bearing assault troops"''; or in other words, remote-controlled killers.

That night, Batman infiltrates into WayneTech, where an illegal operation was taking place. Batman takes out all the thugs and infiltrates into Kenneth Harbinger's office, where he finds the body of the old man, hanging from the cables of his laboratory and his assistant, crying alone for the death of his mentor. Batman checks the computer and searches the files for the Sabbat project and what he finds leaves him speechless. Kenneth Harbinger is the mastermind behind the Bonecrusher. The scientist found a way to use the bodies of other people by placing his mind into the hosts' bodies, which made him happy for being able to feel the sensation of walking and the youth again. For the Bonecrusher project, he recruited eight men with great physical features. He also lied to Bruce about Roy because he was one of his earliest experiments and he got rid of him when Roy started to ask too many questions. In the end, Kenneth was being blackmailed by Riordan and he decided to take his experiments to the next level and transferred his mind and conscience to a different body permanently.

The following days, WayneTech's laboratory for Sabbat Project is dismantled under Bruce Wayne's orders and when he tries to tell Riordan that he is out of the enterprise and that he would report him to the authorities, Riordan show Bruce the documents of the Sabbat Project, supposedly authorizing all the activities in it. Bruce tells Riordan that he isn't scared of him or his forgeries, and Riordan tells Bruce that he also has secret information about him. He tells Bruce that they have been following him for the last fifteen years and that they hold possession of his ultimate secret. Despite the threat Bruce tells him that he is going to carry on with the plan and expose him to the authorities, and Riordan makes his move.

When Bruce arrives at Wayne Manor, he finds that there are Federal Agents, questioning Alfred and his guests. Bruce thinks he knows why they're there, but he is completely surprised when they arrest him under the charges of being a secret spy for the communist party.

Batman plays along and learns that Catwoman's plan is to send her gang on a stealing quest disguised as Batman to frame the vigilante for several crimes. However, when Catwoman asks for everyone of his thugs to take off their masks, Batman is discovered for his reluctance to do so and he is forced to fight his way out of the situation with some help from Robin.

The last of Catwoman's scheme was to disguise one of her thugs as a butler for one of her wealthy acquaintances so he can provide the rest of the gang an easy way inside the house. Bruce Wayne notices something strange and soon learns the plan. Bruce knocks out the fake butler and disguises himself as the man in order to trick the rest of the gang and capture them all at once.

Bruce Wayne spanks him at least ten times (though there could have been further spanking in between panels), which could mean he is turning nine, but there are fourteen candles on his birthday cake.

| StoryTitle1         = The Duped Domestics
| Synopsis1           = 
[[Alfred Beagle (Earth-Two)|Alfred]] has been acting strangely in the last few days without an apparent reason. [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Batman]] and [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Robin]] save one of the butlers that works for a rich man nearby and the butler tells them that he was attacked by some criminals who wanted to take away a picture of a lady called Belinda from him. The butler is apparently in love with this girl and soon, it is revealed that Alfred has also fallen for this lady.

While Bruce and Dick are outside, Alfred spends his time going to the park to meet with Belinda and he tries to court her by telling her that he knows the Batman personally. Belinda dares Alfred to prove his claim and Alfred tells her that he is going to call Batman, but he is not going to be able to return. As Alfred returns to [[Wayne Manor]], he picks one of Bruce's spare [[Batsuit]]s and he puts it on. Dressed as Batman, Alfred returns to the park and posing as the dark knight, he talks wonders about Alfred to Belinda. At that moment a couple of thugs appear out of nowhere and knock Alfred unconscious. The thugs think they've captured Batman and Belinda instructs them to take the man away as it is revealed that she is none other than [[Selina Kyle (Earth-Two)|Catwoman]] and she has been luring the butlers of wealthy people to get information from them.

Later, Batman and Robin return home and they realize that Alfred is gone. Looking through Alfred's personal things, they find a poem dedicated to Belinda and guided by Alfred's poetic description of her, they deduce that she is Catwoman. The duo leave Wayne Manor as Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson to talk to a neighbor and ask if the butler has also been acting strangely, but upon arriving they are captured by Catwoman and her gang and they are locked away in a cold room along with Alfred disguised as Batman.

Working together, Alfred, Bruce and Dick manage to break free and the real Batman and Robin get into action. The dynamic duo rush to Wayne Manor, the place that Catwoman and her gang are stealing, but Alfred can't keep up with them and stays behind. Batman and Robin take care of the criminal gang by capturing all the thugs, but the sneaky Catwoman manages to escape unnoticed. As she returns to her hideout, she encounters Alfred, who was still wearing the Batsuit. At the sight of Batman, Catwoman surrenders and allows "Batman" to arrest her. However, Alfred has something else in mind before taking her to the police and he tells her that the punishment will hurt her more than it will hurt him.&lt;!-- Oh Alfie, you dirty old man --&gt;

Back in Wayne Manor the [[Gotham City Police Department]] take the criminals away, leaving Bruce and Dick safe in their home. The duo realize that Alfred hasn't returned yet and a few moments later, someone knocks the door. Bruce answers the door and he is surprised to see Alfred, still wearing the batsuit and carrying Catwoman with him. Alfred, pretending to be Batman, asks Bruce for a telephone to contact the police and inform them of his capture. While Alfred calls the police, Dick tells Catwoman to sit down until they police arrive, but she is not willing to sit down as a result of Alfred's punishment.&lt;!-- Alfred-- you dirty f**ed up perv --&gt;

The next day, Alfred's attitude has improved and he has returned to act normally. While he tells Bruce and Dick about Catwoman's plan to steal from everyone in the vicinity, Bruce remarks that maybe Alfred was a bit too harsh with her.&lt;!-- Jealous Brucie? At least Alfred's got the balls to do what you won't --&gt; Alfred insists that she deserved it for toying with his affections and he also tells the duo that he perfomed quite good as Batman; to which Bruce replies that he was more than good according to Catwoman.&lt;!-- Ladies and gentlemen... this is euphemism level 9999 --&gt;

| StoryTitle2         = Dick Grayson, Telegraph Boy
| Synopsis2           = 
Dick Grayson gets a job as a telegraph boy and he is asked to do all sorts of things while delivering messages. Certain day, Dick delivers a telegraph at the [[Gotham Observatory]] and he recognizes that the man who takes the message, is a criminal. Going back to the secret laboratory, he tries to identify the crook and soon, Bruce joins his search. After learning the identity of the thug, Batman and Robin go to the observatory to capture the criminal, who has also captured the main scientist at the observatory. Batman and Robin have to comply to the crooks' orders to save the scientist and so they are left tied up in the observatory while the crooks go on their way to rob a bank.

Batman and Robin manage to break free and they follow the criminals across the city to the planetarium, where the final showdown takes place and all the gang is captured. In the end, Dick decides to give up his job but first he needs to deliver one last message. The next day, Dick delivers a present to Bruce, as it is his birthday and Alfred gives him a new present: a telescope.

| StoryTitle3         = Conversational Clue
| Synopsis3           = By mistake, [[Alfred Beagle (Earth-Two)|Alfred]] has taken a Professor of Criminology's notebook only to discover that the professor is really a safe-cracker. Inside the notebook is a list of places he plans to rob, and Alfred is on the case alone. Without the help of Batman and Robin, Alfred manages to stop the criminals and returns home to keep up with his chores.

| StoryTitle4         = The Cavalier Rides Again
| Synopsis4           = 
The [[Mortimer Drake (New Earth)|Cavalier]] is ready to strike again and steal something of great value to add to his still empty collection. This time, Cavalier is prepared to confront Batman and Robin, as he has set up a series of traps for the dynamic duo. His plan is successful and Cavalier manages to capture the vigilantes. After his victory, Cavalier takes off his costume and reveals his true identity as high society playboy Mortimer Drake.

Batman and Robin manage to escape Cavalier's trap and they find a clue left behind. The duo decide to stop their hunt for the night, as Bruce has to attend to an important event, where Mortimer Drake is also present. Ironically, the two enemies find themselves chatting in a normal way, not knowing their true identities.

The next night, Cavalier strikes and he tries to steal some precious diamonds, but Batman and Robin appear at the crime scene after decoding Cavalier's clue. The dynamic duo manage to capture Cavalier's gang and retrieve the stolen diamonds, but Cavalier manages to escape once again. Both Bruce Wayne and Mortimer Drake are frustrated for their unsuccesful encounters, but they also have admiration for each other.

| StoryTitle1         = Your Face Is Your Fortune
| Synopsis1           = 
[[Selina Kyle (Earth-Two)|Catwoman]] has taken the identity of Elva Barr, a cosmetologist working on a beauty salon in [[Gotham City]]. The ultimate purpose of her disguise, is to adopt the identities of the women who go to the salon and impersonate them in order to steal valuable objects. However, she is recognized by [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Bruce Wayne]] during a beauty contest for beauty salon operators. Bruce is one of the judges of the event and with his vote, Elva Barr wins the contest. During the crowning, Bruce presents her with the prize and Catwoman begins to fall for Gotham's playboy.

Bruce informs [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Dick Grayson]] about his encounter with Catwoman and they decide to follow Elva Barr after she leaves the beauty salon. For a moment, it seems like Catwoman is finally going straight, but after a while, the duo learns that she has still some connections with the underground. After a quick investigation and a confrontation with some of her thugs, Batman and Robin learn that Catwoman will strike next during a wedding ceremony disguised as another woman.

The heist takes place as planned, but on her way out of the place, Catwoman is stopped by Batman while Robin fights her henchmen. Catwoman is stopped by Batman and there, she asks him for a second chance at redemtion now that she has found love in Bruce Wayne. Batman is shocked to learn that Catwoman is in love with him and he allows her to escape after she promised she'd go straight if she gets a chance with Bruce.

In the following days, Bruce starts dating Elva and a few days later, their engagement becomes known to the public. It is then that Catwoman tells her gang that she is leaving crime forever, but one of her men informs her that Bruce Wayne has been dating [[Linda Page (Earth-Two)|Linda Page]] longer than her, placing the seed of doubt on Catwoman. Meanwhile, Linda is devastated by the news of Bruce's engagement and she decides to pay a visit to Elva Barr at her beauty salon, to know the woman Bruce changed her for. Linda's innocent motivation is used by Catwoman to her advantage when she creates a mask with the features of Linda's face in order to learn the truth.

Posing as Linda, Catwoman meets Bruce and inquires Bruce about his engagement. Bruce tells "Linda" that the engagement is fake and that he is only doing so because Batman asked him to do it until Catwoman leaves crime. Learning the truth, Catwoman leaves the place and Bruce returns home, where Dick informs him that Linda called on the phone to congratulate him on his engagement. Bruce finally realizes Catwoman's deception and soon, the master criminal starts a crime spree across Gotham, leaving her good intentions in the past.

Batman and Robin follow one of Catwoman's thugs to an animal exhibition, where they find her trying to steal some of the fine animals. The dynamic duo takes down all of the thugs and later, Batman gives chase to Catwoman, who stumbles over a group of cats, allowing Batman to capture her.

| Synopsis1           = 
[[Selina Kyle (Earth-Two)|Catwoman]] escapes from prison and starts a crime spree, basing her crimes on famous fictional cat stories. [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Batman]] and [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Robin]] investigate the case and they confront the plunder princess on several occassions, but they are outsmarted each time.

| Synopsis2           =

Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has been left blind on a heroic act while saving a kid from a burning building. The doctor informs Bruce that the blindness is temporal and that he should be able to see in 72 hours. Later, Bruce gets a letter from the criminal who believes he is Batman and he is challenged to stop his next crimes to prove the contrary. Batman goes to the place and with help from Robin, he manages to land some hits on the criminals, but they are eventually victorious over the Dynamic Duo. The criminal prepares another test to challenge Batman's sight and using a trick of his own, Batman manages to overcome the test. Batman gets ready to capture the thug, but using one last resort, the thug tells Batman to shoot a cigarette out of his hand to finally prove he is not blind as Bruce Wayne. Batman picks the gun up, but before he could even shoot, a bullet strikes the cigarette out of the thug's hand. The criminal runs away and Batman learns that the person who fired was the police officer who suspected his true identity.

After the criminals are captured, Batman proves to a whole audience that he is not Bruce Wayne by throwing darts right to the center of the board. The crowd is convinced, but they don't know that Robin has placed a magnet behind the board, which causes the darts to always hit in the center.

Three criminals who had been sentenced to life in prison are set free on their old years by an unknown person.

Using the robots,  the thugs start a crime spree in Gotham City and their actions get the attention of Batman and Robin. After a first failed encounter with one of the robots, Batman and Robin prepare a plan to destroy one of them the next time they strike. After their plan proves successful, they come up with another idea to destroy the second robot and capture the people who are controlling the machines. Batman and Robin force one of the robots to climb to the top of the highest building in Gotham during a thunderstorm and as a result, the giant machine is hit by lightning which in turn causes the thugs controlling the robots to be stunned at their base of operations. This actions lead to the arrest of the criminals and the end to the robot robberies.

After long hours of investigation, Batman finds that The Artisan is unknown even to his own henchmen, but despite this lack of clues, Batman manages to uncover the true identity of the criminal as the renowned editor of the Gotham Gazette.

When a new series of cat-related crimes start taking place in Gotham, everybody suspects that [[Selina Kyle (Earth-Two)|Catwoman]] has returned to her evil ways. However, Selina Kyle is now the owner of a pet store and she is innocent of all charges. Batman and Robin investigate the crimes and find some evidence that is later reported on the newspapers. Selina is shocked to read the news as some of the evidence seems to point towards her as responsible for the crimes. After this, a gang leader called Whale Morton approaches Selina and offers her an alliance to make her the most successful criminal in town and Selina joins him, taking up again the mantle of Catwoman again.

Catwoman leads Morton's gang on a successful crime spree, but coincidentally, there is always a Cat-Signal coming from the crime scenes during the robberies. The Dynamic Duo follow this beacon and always manage to capture some of the lesser thugs, but never the leaders. During one of these attempts, Batman and Robin are finally captured by Morton and Catwoman, who place them in a deadly trap. When Batman manages to break free from the trap, he turns off the lights and captures almost the entire gang with help from Catwoman. At that very moment, the police arrive as they have been watching the whole scene on TV and it is then revealed that Catwoman had prepared a live broadcast of the events to tip off the police in case anything went wrong. The criminals are finally arrested and Catwoman informs the Dynamic Duo that she was working as an undercover agent to capture the thugs the whole time.

Their hunch proves right and they soon confront the princess of plunder at the exhibition. Catwoman is defeated and captured before she returns to prison.

Together, they capture the criminals and inform the local sheriff about the situation.

Before leaving the prison, Batman informs the convicts that they are no longer going to be used for criminal labors and instead, they will be given a rightful chance to redeem themselves.

On their way back to [[Wayne Manor]], Batman and Robin find a truck that crashed over the side of a ridge. They find the driver killed on impact, but as they move around the back of the truck a secret door opens, and a man steps out. Surprised at Batman's and Robin's presence, he knocks out Robin with his pistol and takes aim at Batman, but is shot by officers just in time. The officers tell Batman that he was a criminal trying to secretly cross state lines.

Upon investigating the trucking company, Batman finds that it was recently purchased by [[Joe Chill (Earth-Two)|Joe Chill]], the man responsible for the death of his parents. Batman remembers Chill shooting his father, his mother dying of shock, and the promise he made at their grave to fight crime. He decides to take the case, alone.

His first attempt to get at Chill is to pose as a driver looking for work, but Chill refuses to hire him. Batman decides to set a trap for Chill. He boards a gambling showboat and points it into state waters so police can make legal arrests. The boat owner makes a quick getaway as soon as police show up, and goes to Chill in order to get smuggled out of the state.

As a precaution, Chill checks a secret camera in his office and sees Batman has followed the boat owner. He shoots the boat owner for letting Batman follow, and when Batman enters the room, lies about shooting in self-defense. Without any evidence to the contrary, Batman reveals his identity to Chill and promises him that he will always be watching, waiting for Chill to make a mistake.

Terrified, Chill runs into a room with some of his men and explains that Batman is after him for killing his father. Chill's men are angry that Chill "created" the Batman, and shoot him before he can tell them Batman's identity. Batman hurries into the room and dispatches the men, and watches as Chill succumbs to the bullet wounds. The case of Thomas Wayne's murder is closed.

| StoryTitle1         = The Secret Life of the Catwoman!
| Synopsis1           = The gang czar [[Mousey (Earth-Two)|Mister X]] terrorizes [[Gotham City]], and decides he wants to work with [[Selina Kyle (Earth-Two)|Catwoman]]. [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Batman]] and [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Robin]] are shocked to hear from [[James Gordon (Earth-Two)|Commissioner Gordon]] that Catwoman has been broken out of jail with dynamite. Mister X offers to plan heists and have Catwoman commit them so they can share the loot. Catwoman works with X's henchman Dipper, and they make fun of a wannabe crook named Mousey. 

When Catwoman leaves her hideout, she finds Batman and Robin waiting for her. They try to give chase, but she throws a box at them with angry cat inside it. Batman runs towards falling debris, and Catwoman realizes he will be killed. Instead of escaping, she leaps to save Batman's life and gets hit in the head by a brick. 

They wake her up in the [[Batcave]], where she feverishly screams about airline rules. It's revealed that Selina Kyle was a stewardess, who fell out of a crashing plane and got amnesia. Kyle is horrified to hear that she's become a criminal in her amnesiac state. Batman asks about her obsession with cats, and she explains that her father used to own a pet store. He taught her all about cats, and she subconsciously remembered that through her amnesia. 

Gordon asks Kyle to go undercover and help them take down Mister X. Mousey is brought into the station and hears their scheme, so Gordon has him put in jail. Mousey breaks out with a hidden file, swearing revenge on Catwoman. 

Catwoman pulls several heists for Mister X, although crime now disgusts her. This includes distracting a record company with cats while she steals gold-plated records, and opening a bank vault with cats. Batman and Robin fight her on a Giant Cash Register, but this is a ruse so they can fake being captured. Catwoman takes them back to Mister X, who locks them alone with a time bomb. Mister X tells Catwoman he knows about her treachery, and has her dragged off a cliff via tractor. Batman and Robin escape in time to rescue her and punch out Mister X's thugs. It's revealed that Mousey was Mister X all along. He wore a bulky costume to make other crooks respect him. 

In the aftermath, Selina Kyle officially retires from her career as Catwoman. However, Batman insists that the police may still need her as an operative -- sooner than she thinks. 

| StoryTitle2         = The Batman of England!
| Synopsis2           = 
The amazing adventures and heroical feats of [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Batman]] and [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Robin]] have reached an old town in [[England]] called [[Wordenshire]], where a wealthy man and his son have decided to emulate the famous Dynamic Duo and adopt the identities of [[Percival Sheldrake (New Earth)|Knight]] and [[Cyril Sheldrake (New Earth)|Squire]].

When a criminal from [[Gotham City]] relocates to England, Batman and Robin travel to the island where they  meet their English counterparts, Knight and Squire. Having much to learn of the crime-fighting trade, Batman and Robin decide to train them to improve their skills and while doing so, they are able to capture the criminal at large.

| StoryTitle3         = The Mystery of Millionaire Island!
| Synopsis3           = 
Bruce Wayne and several other millionaires are summoned to an special event in an undisclosed island. Upon arriving, it is revealed that they have all been brought to a trap and the only way out of the island is to reveal their most important secret of their financial success. When some of the millionaires refuse to give away their secrets, they are killed and their bodies taken away. Desperate for help, the wealthy men craft a make-shift [[Bat-Signal]], which allows Bruce to change into Batman and start investigating the case. Robin arrives soon after watching the Bat-Signal and together they uncover the responsible behind the millionaire island. The criminal was one of the wealthy men, the first one to apparently die. He had prepared the place to convince the others that he was killing them, when in reality, he was just knocking them unconscious and taking them to a cellar.

| StoryTitle1         = Nine Lives has the Catwoman!
| Synopsis1           = 
Catwoman arrives at Gotham's woman's prison, but in less than a few days she manages to escape. Catwoman tries to gather her old gang back, but her former henchmen won't side with her for fear of being captured by [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Batman]]. Catwoman then prepares a trick to impress the thugs, making them believe that she has nine lives, like the legend says about cats and after the demonstration, Catwoman gets her gang back and she starts preparing a new secret hideout: the Cat-acombs.

{{Image|Selina Kyle Earth-Two 004.jpg|Batman chasing Catwoman|right}}On her first crime Catwoman tries to steal using a zeppelin, but Batman and [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Robin]] locate her and in the ensuing fight, Catwoman falls from the blimp and she is presummed dead. However, she lands on a river and making her way to the city, she starts a crime spree, risking her life at every turn, but succesfully stealing all the loot.

Batman and Robin track Catwoman down to her secret hideout, which is located on a cavern system on the outskirts of the city. Once inside, Catwoman traps Batman and Robin on a gigantic maze, while she and her gang go out to commit more crimes. Batman and Robin find the exit of the maze using their [[Batrope]]s and the capes from their suit and once in Catwoman's main room at her base of operations, they learn about her next move. The Dynamic Duo move fast to capture Catwoman, but the cunning thief tries a desperate move and she pretends to drive a tractor away from the danger zone, but in her haste she crashes against a boulder that causes the vehicle to lose stability and she falls to a chasm to her apparent death. However, Batman is suspicious about Catwoman's actual death.

| StoryTitle2         = Dinosaur Island!
| Synopsis2           = 
A wealthy industrialist builds a theme park that he calls Dinosaur Island. The place is filled with functional robot replicas of [[Dinosaurs|dinosaurs]] and robotic cavemen. In order to test the accuracy of a pre-historic representation, the owners of the park ask [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Batman]] and [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Robin]] to be part of a game in which they would spend 36 hours on the island and they have to survive the various dangers of the pre-historic age without aid from any of their modern equipment including the Bat-vehicles or the [[Utility Belt]].

The [[Dynamic Duo]] accept the challenge, but a criminal takes control of the island in order to eliminate Batman and Robin, making it look like an accident. Batman and Robin's resourcefulness allows them not only to survive the required time, but also capture the infiltrated criminal who tried to kill them.

| StoryTitle3         = Dick Grayson, Author!
| Synopsis3           = 
[[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Dick Grayson]] has been reading several comic books and he thinks that some of the stories are too far away from reality. [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Bruce]] takes Dick to talk with a friend of his, who happens to be the editor of a comic book that Dick reads. After listening to Dick's complaints, the editor gives Dick the chance to write his own story for comics and despite Dick's initial excitement, later he realizes that he can't create an interesting story that hasn't been done before.

In the meantime, some reformed criminals have started their own delivery company, but they have been victims of robberies and the people distrust them because of their criminal past. Batman and Robin investigate the case and find the real criminals behind the robberies, clearing the name of the former convicts.

After the real criminals have been captured, Dick decides to write his comic story about the [[Dynamic Duo]]'s recent adventure and when he gives the story to the comic book editor, he is so impressed by Dick's work that he buys the script for the story and even tells Dick that he would buy as many stories as Dick can create. Considering that his inspiration comes from his real life, Bruce wishes that Dick's career as a writer lasts at least a hundred years.

* The "Dinosaur Island" in the second story should not be confused with [[Dinosaur Island]]. The island in this story is a showman's private island filled with robots of dinosaurs and cavemen.
| Trivia              = 
* This issue marks the first appearance of Catwoman with her new outfit, which would become a classic feature on her career. However, the first official appearance of this suit is in {{c|Detective Comics #112}}, but it wasn't worn by Catwoman. Also, in this issue Catwoman's hair is blond instead of her usual dark hair, which is most likely a mistake.
* The Dinosaur Island story is largely considered to be the origin of the robotic T-Rex part of the main memorabilia in the [[Batcave]]. However, a robotic T-Rex had already appeared in {{c|Batman #10}}.

| Synopsis1           = 
Roger Ryall and his criminal gang manage to steal the psychiatric files from a renowned doctor and his patients. So begins a crime spree in which the thugs would rob people by using their worst fears against them. [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Batman]] and [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Robin]] investigate the case and they learn the worst fear of Ryall is cats.

Using cats against the thug, the Dynamic Duo are able to stop the crimes and capture the gang, but unfortunately Ryall is literally scared to death.

| StoryTitle2         = The Man In the Iron Mask!
| Synopsis2           = 
A crook by the name of Iron-Hat Ferris is double-crossed by his gang and he is forced to wear an iron mask on his head. Seeking help from old friends, Ferris is forced to steal a thousand dollars to get the help he needs to remove the mask. In his attempt to get the money, he is again double-crossed and his "friend" gives an anonymous tip to the police. Batman and Robin try to stop the criminal, but Ferris escapes and he finds himself wandering on the streets until Henry Kendall locates him. Kendall is the candiate to become D.A. of Gotham City and he pretends to gain some reputation using Ferris.

In the next days, the news about the crimes of the man in the iron mask flood the media and Batman starts looking for the criminal. During a confrontation at an iron exhibit, the criminal escapes once again, but Batman manages to attach a transmitter on the iron mask. Using the receiver incorporated to the [[Batmobile]], Batman and Robin track down the criminal to an abandoned mansion, where they confront the man once again. This time the Dynamic Duo are victorious, but they realize that Ferris is also in the place as a hostage and is not wearing the mask anymore. It is then revealed that the man with the iron mask is in fact Kendall, who then tries to escape from the place, but he is killed by lightning that strikes down on his head. The explanation is that the iron mask attracted the lightning, ending Kendall's political career and life.

| StoryTitle3         = A Christmas Tale!
| Synopsis3           = 
During Christmas Holidays in [[Gotham City]], [[Selina Kyle (Earth-Two)|Catwoman]] and her gang start stealing cats from some people. Batman and Robin are informed of the recent crimes, but they can't make sense of Catwoman's purpose, since she can't ask ransom for these cats.

The answer to this question comes a few days later, when Bruce learns of an Egyptian cat exhibition that is being held at the Gotham Museum. Catwoman uses the first cat to distract the Museum's guards and knock them unconscious. While she tries to steal some precious objects, Batman and Robin arrive in time to stop her, but with her henchmen's help, they are able to outmatch the Dynamic Duo. However, when one of the thugs tries to kill Batman, Catwoman stops him and prevents Batman's death.

Upon recovering, Batman and Robin investigate the clues lefts by the thugs and find out that they are most likely going to a cold place called Moon Valley. The Dynamic Duo travel there in the [[Batplane]] and upon arriving, they realize that Catwoman's henchmen are using the second cat as a distraction in dog sled race. Batman and Robin get into action using their white camouflage [[Batsuit]]s and they manage to capture Catwoman's thugs. In the meantime, Catwoman is using the third stolen cat to steal from a nearby hotel. Batman and Robin arrive just in time to prevent Catwoman from escaping with the loot.

As Batman carries Catwoman to the authorities, she tries to convince him to join her and become partners in crime, but Batman refuses the proposition, as he usually does. Afterwards, Batman returns the cats to their owners, giving them an emotional Christmas present and for some even a great monetary reward.

A strange criminal dubbed the "[[James Garth (Earth-Two)|Blaze]]" hits the streets of [[Gotham City]] and his methods are perplexing to all the authorities.

[[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Batman]] and [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Robin]] get on the track of the criminal and prevent some deaths, but some other people are killed by the maniac. After a long investigation, Batman finds out that the Blaze is acting on a personal vendetta against a specific group of people who were part of a firefighter volunteer team. As part of said team, Batman is the last victim of the Blaze, but during their encounter, the criminal jumps into a cave full of dynamite with the flamethrower active, killing himself in a gigantic explosion.

[[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Bruce Wayne]] becomes involved with a film studio that is producing a Batman movie. When he realizes that the film is the target of a large gang of criminals, Bruce infiltrates the film studio as the actor who would play Batman. While filming the movie, Batman performs all sorts of ridiculous tasks that the director and writer believe to be Batman's modus operandi. After enduring almost the entire shooting of the film, Batman discovers that the person who is trying to sabotage the film's production is in fact the screenwriter, who wants the film to be cancelled so he could have the rights to sell the movie again to another studio. The small time crook is captured by Batman and [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Robin]].

| StoryTitle3         = The King of the Cats!
| Synopsis3           = 
A new criminal who calls himself the [[Karl Kyle (Earth-Two)|King of the Cats]] starts operating in [[Gotham City]], using the same methods as the notorious ex-criminal, the [[Selina Kyle (Earth-Two)|Catwoman]]. [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Batman]] and [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Robin]] soon get on the trail of the King of the Cats and realize that he is trying to convince Selina Kyle into going back to her life of crime with him. When Batman and Robin try to stop him, Selina knocks them unconscious and allows the King of the Cats to go, hoping that he would make the right choice and turn himself to the police.

Selina then frees the Dynamic Duo, who get on the trail of the criminal at large and they confront the Cat criminal on the [[Gotham Zoo]]. During their confrontation, Batman and the King of the Cats fall down to the cages of different feline beasts. Catwoman arrives in time to save them both and after her heroic sacrifice, the King of Cats surrenders to Batman, allowing himself to be taken to the authorities. It is then that Batman learns that the King of Cats is Selina's brother.

| Quotation           = '''Why'''? But, [[Anthony Lupus (New Earth)|Anthony]]... it's really quite '''simple'''. I want you to '''murder''' someone for me! I want you to kill [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-One)|the Batman]].

| StoryTitle1         = Moon of the Wolf
| Synopsis1           = 
During a full moon night in [[Gotham City]], [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-One)|Batman]] spots a terrible creature climbing the side of a building and entering the apartment of a young woman. After killing the lady's pet, the beast directs his attention to the woman, but Batman arrives in time to stop the beast from harming his victim. Without an easy way out, the beast grabs the woman and tosses her out through the window, several storeys from the ground. Batman dives behind and grabs the woman during the free fall before using his [[Batrope]] to swing her back to safety. By the time Batman takes the woman to a safe place, the ferocious beast has escaped leaving no traces behind.

{{Image|James Gordon Earth-One 0004.jpg|Batman and Gordon|right}}
Batman then pays a visit to [[James Gordon (Earth-One)|Commissioner Gordon]] at the [[GCPD Headquarters]], where he informs the Commissioner about his latest encounter with the man disguised as a beast. Gordon then tells Batman about the robbery of a couple of timber wolves from the [[Gotham Zoo]] and he believes that there is a connection between both crimes. Batman agrees, but he also starts to suspect that maybe the attacker was not wearing a disguise.

At dawn, the beast returns to the hidden laboratory of [[Achilles Milo (New Earth)|Professor Milo]] where he transforms back to his human form of [[Anthony Lupus (New Earth)|Anthony Lupus]], a former professional athlete who started having unbearable headaches due to an illness known as lycantrophy. Lupus sought medical help, but nobody was able to provide a cure for his illness, until he met Milo, who gave him a serum that stopped his constant headaches, but instead, it caused him to turn into a werewolf during full moon nights. Lupus explains that his transformations are worsening and that he might lose control of his acts when transformed into a werewolf, which is why he needs a cure from Milo, but Milo refuses to give him the antidote until he has succeeded in killing Milo's personal enemy, Batman.

Seeking to lure Batman into a trap, Lupus puts out word about a charity donation he wants to deliver to Batman personally and this reaches Bruce Wayne's ears. One night, Batman goes to Lupus' place in order to receive the donation, but he is taken inside a locked room, where he is knocked unconscious with gas.

{{Image|Werewolf 01.jpg|The Werewolf Attacks}}
Moments later, Lupus takes Batman to a construction site near Milo's secret laboratory and he handcuffs the hero to the ground with chains before going to Milo's lab and asking one more time for the cure. Milo wouldn't give the antidote until Batman has been murdered by the werewolf, but Lupus knows that he will lose control of his next transformation. Milo doesn't heed the warning and when the full moon rises, Lupus turns into a werewolf and attacks Milo, destroying the antidote.

In the meantime, Batman has recovered and he tries to break free from the chains, when the werewolf appears and prepares an attack on the Caped Crusader. Batman manages to break free in time to fight back and as they struggle, a storm unleashes. With rain and thunders as their background, Batman and the werewolf take the fight to the construction site, several storeys above the ground. Once there, the fight continues and Batman uses a metallic rod to impale the beast in the shoulder. However, the werewolf doesn't seem to feel pain and he starts pulling the object out of his body until a lightning strikes at him, attracted by the metallic rod. Batman is only able to watch as the burning body of the werewolf collapses to the ground and by the time Batman reaches the spot where the werewolf landed, he is only able to find the charred metallic rod.

Nothing is ever known about the werewolf in Gotham City, but not long after this, the legend about a man hunting wolves, and a pack led by a beast start to spread in the cold lands of [[Alaska]].

The boys then help stop a plot by the Spanish Duke De Gatz to start a war between France and England. After the Musketeers have defeated the Duke, Vernet mixes another chemical concoction which returns them to their own time. 

Many years later, working from Vernet's notes, Alexander Dumas changes the story, so that the Musketeers are men rather than boys.

A man named [[William Jensen (Earth-Two)|Bill Jensen]], armed with inexplicable power scales the top of the [[Gotham City|Gotham]] Towers where he single-handedly defeats the [[Justice Society of America (New Earth)|Justice Society of America]]. Jensen screams that he wants to avenge himself against Commissioner Bruce Wayne, whom he believes framed him in order to further his own career. When Wayne learns of the situation, he has little choice but to come out of retirement and operate as [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Batman]] one last time. Swinging to the top of the tower, he catches the [[Jason Garrick (New Earth)|Flash]], whom Jensen had hurled from the rooftop. He rests him on a ledge, then scales the tower to confront Jensen.

The other JSA members continue fighting him, but even the combined might of [[Alan Scott (New Earth)|Green Lantern]] and [[Kent Nelson (New Earth)|Doctor Fate]] cannot stop him. Batman approaches him, and Jensen turns his power against him. He continues to struggle forward until both combatants are locked in a violent embrace. Jensen's power sears away Batman's mask, and he realizes that this is the man he has sworn to destroy -- Bruce Wayne. Driven to even greater fury, Jensen's power burns out of control, consuming both men. The Batman, one of the first and most infamous of Mystery Men... is dead.

In the following days, Bruce Wayne's body is laid to rest next to the grave of his wife, [[Selina Kyle (Earth-Two)|Selina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{c|DC Super-Stars #17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his parents. His daughter [[Helena Wayne (Earth-Two)|Helena]] speaks with [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Dick Grayson]] about the future of the Batman legacy. Helena solemnly states that only "legends live forever".

Jake is now a para-psychologist and enlists Iris' aid in assisting him with an experiment dealing with astral projection. Barry is immediately distrustful of Jake and follows them to [[Central City University]] as the Flash. He then decides to respect Iris' privacy and returns home. At their house, Barry sees a wraith-like image of Iris and realizes that something is wrong.

He races to the University, changes back to Barry Allen and consults with Forrest. He learns that something is threatening to sever the spiritual cord connecting Iris' astral self to her corporeal body. Barry leaves and moves at super-speed until he can match the frequency needed to enter the astral world.

Exploring the strange terrain, he discovers that a monstrous She-Demon plans on taking possession of Iris' body. The Flash rescues Iris' astral self and returns it to her body. Iris awakens, but has no memory of what had transpired.

| StoryTitle3         = Deadman: "The Sins of the Father"
| Synopsis3           = Alexi Kronsky confesses to his daughter and the other circus performers, that after his wife died in Russia, he perfected his "encephalopathic transmogrifier", a helmet that can transform thoughts into solid matter. He transformed the device into a giant wooden elephant, and hid it in Hill's Circus when they were performing in Russia. He continues to say, that he escaped the Soviet Union and came to America, where he offered to sell the device to the famous Mr. Solomon. Instead, Solomon took him prisoner and offered to free him, if he told him the device's location. He was able to escape his imprisonment and run to the circus.

Also hearing the conversation, are Solomon and his men who have been hiding outside. They storm into the circus trailer with guns and attempt to recapture Kronsky and take the "elephant." But the performers, with the help of Deadman, rebuff them. Kronsky transforms the wooden elephant into the actual helmet again, wears it, and uses "his thoughts" to kill Solomon and his thugs, while declaring, "I have the power--and that is more than enough!"

The sea king's protests are in vain. Later, Aquaman infiltrates U.F.P. again, overhears its head, Mr. Amos, admitting that Atlantis's farmlands will be laid waste through overproduction in a year, but that by that time they will know how to do underwater farming on their own. Aquaman is captured, but fights his way out. When he goes to Vulko again with the new information, Aquaman is again rebuffed, and Vulko orders his guards to put Aquaman under arrest.

| StoryTitle1         = Blind Justice, Part Three

'''Chapter Five: Hidden Agendas'''

The manhunter called [[Henri Ducard (New Earth)|Henri Ducard]] has been called to [[Gotham City]], to testify againts [[Bruce Wayne (New Earth)|Bruce Wayne]]. In the meantime, [[Kenneth Harbinger (New Earth)|Dr. Harbinger]], who transferred his mind into the body of the hobo man who shot Bruce Wayne, has changed his appearance and is now a middle class gentleman that nobody would suspect of the shooting.

At the Hospital, Bruce recovers from his coma, but the doctors tell him that he might not be able to walk again. Because of that, Batman haven't been seen for two weeks and [[James Gordon (New Earth)|James Gordon]] is trying his best to cover Batman's disappearance.

Henri Ducard meets with Mitchell Riordan to discuss the deal about Bruce Wayne's trial. Riordan wants Ducard to expose Bruce Wayne's activities in Paris, ten years ago and in return, the cartel he works for would take care of the many international authorities following Ducard. At the trial would be in a few more days, Ducard decided to spend his time in Gotham by analyzing the city's most famous person: Batman.

Bruce leaves the hospital in a wheelchair and [[Alfred Pennyworth (New Earth)|Alfred]] drives him home when they decide to enter via the [[Batcave]], because of the inconvenience of using the stairs. Meanwhile at [[Wayne Manor]], some Federal Agents search the house for any missing clue they might have overlooked on the many times they searched before, despite to Jeannie and Roy's annoyance. When the agents leave the house, Jeannie goes upstairs to clean up the mess, while Roy does the same in the library and he accidentally opens a secret door behind the book shelf. Bruce and Alfred arrive at the Batcave and notice that the alarm has been triggered. Soon they realize that Roy has discovered the secret entrance to the Batcave and Bruce asks him to keep the secret from everyone else, including Jeannie. Roy agrees with one condition: he wants to help Bruce by being his remote controlled soldier using Harbinger's technology, but Bruce refuses.

Elsewhere, Ducard has finished analyzing Batman's history and motives and has come to the conclusion that Batman and Bruce Wayne are too similar to be a coincidence.

At that moment, Harbinger wanders around the city using a new device that allows him to control people's actions just with his voice command.

The next day, Jeannie takes Bruce out for a walk to Wayne Manor's garden and she tries to make Bruce understand that they're perfect for each other. Meanwhile, Alfred and Roy are at the Batcave and are ready to test Harbinger's mind controlling device. Moments later Roy walks to where Bruce and Jeannie were, carrying a tray. Bruce noticed something unusual and asked Jeannie to go inside the house, just to be alone with Roy. Bruce realizes that Alfred is controlling Roy's body and regrets not having destroyed the device.

'''Chapter Six: Covert Operations'''

Alfred and Roy have convinced Bruce to use the mind controlling device in order to make Batman appear during his time in a wheelchair. Roy wears the [[Batsuit]] and Bruce uses his body to reach the [[GCPD Headquarters]] and talk to Gordon, who was flashing the [[Bat-Signal]], as he has done every night for two weeks. His reappearance convinces Gordon and the police that he is fine and back for good, but Bruce can feel Roy's body growing weary and tired as the night passes. Howver, and despite those facts, "Batman" stops a crime in progress after which he is exhausted and walks away from the scene, allowing people and the press to notice his presence. When Roy returned to the Batcave, he feels wasted but he desires to carry on until they capture Harbinger.

Riordan is at his base of operations, supervising the development of the mind control devices when he is called to his office by Ducard. The manhunter explains that the accusations of Bruce Wayne being a spy are out of context. He explains with details of his experience with a young Bruce Wayne and how all the past events lead to one and single truth: Bruce Wayne is Batman. Riordan couldn't agree with Ducard because in that day's newspapers, Batman was sighted and stopped crimes the night before, whereas Bruce Wayne is still in a wheelchair. Ducard thinks that he might be for once mistaken, but when he is outside and thinking clearly, he realizes that Bruce must be using the mind control device and another body to impersonate Batman and eliminate suspicions.

As Ducard leaves the building, Harbinger enters it using the device that bends people to his will and makes his way to Riordan's office, where he forces the man to be submissive and honest with him. At that moment, Bruce deduces that he can use the device to see through other people's eyes, but only of those that have the biochip, and thus he realized that he can track Harbinger that way. When Bruce starts the machine, he is able to see through many people's eyes, and one of the is Harbinger. However, Alfred tuned the frequency so that he can control the body of one of the Bonecrusher prototypes in the same room that Harbinger and Riordan are. Harbinger asks Riordan to give him back his project, the hardware and all the information. When Harbinger escapes the building with all his devices and information, Bruce tries to follow with his controlled body but Alfred disconnects him before he could reach Harbinger. Bruce tries to locate the man again but Harbinger has disappeared from the system and he can't be reached in the same way. However, the computer saved some of Harbinger's body memory and Bruce is able to create an image of the face after and before Harbinger's possession of the body, and he send it to the [[Gotham City Police Department]].

At that moment, Henri Ducard arrives at Wayne Manor, looking to speak with Bruce. Ducard tells Bruce that he already knows his secret and that he is willing to help him in the trial, if in return he gives him a new identity with the Harbinger machine. Bruce refuses the offer and Henri leaves just when Roy enters the living room and tells Bruce that he is ready for another round in the cape and cowl.

Bruce uses Roy's body again, and first he tries to make Jeannie see the truth about her and Bruce, but she wouldn't listen. Bruce then decides it's time to get Roy in the Bat-Suit, one last time.

That moment, Riordan is being punished by the cartel for giving away the Harbinger device and he is beat to a pulp. However, Harbinger calls him and asks him for the last piece of information and Riordan tells him that he is ready to deliver it.

'''Chapter Seven: Ulterior Motives'''

After the GCPD was given the facial recognition of the man who attacked Bruce Wayne, they tracked him down to a hotel in Gotham. Harbinger knows that he would be history if he is caught and thus, he sets a bomb in his apartment, but before it explodes he uses his device one last time, to change bodies permanently, and this time, he switched over one of the Bonecrusher test subjects.

Roy, in the batsuit and controlled remotely by Bruce Wayne, is waiting outside Riordan's place and he follows the man once he starts moving. "Batman" follows Riordan to the cartel's secret lab, where Riordan meets with Harbinger. Riordan gives Harbinger all the legal information on the project and the remaining pieces of the mind control device. "Batman" infiltrates the building and takes down some of the guards when he is surrounded by many Bonecrushers, including Harbinger. While Batman fights them all, he notices that one of them is leaving with a briefcase and he follows him outside through a window. They both land on the railroad tracks, but Batman's leg is trapped when one of the wood tracks and Harbinger notices the chance to eliminate Batman once and for all. Bruce can't make Roy's leg loose and so he decides to switch the frequency and control Harbinger's body instead. Bruce controls Harbinger's body now and Roy regains control of his body, but is in pain and shock for finding himself against Bonecrusher. Bruce tries to make him understand but Roy fights him back and as they fight, a train gets closer to them. Bruce is unable to control Roy and they are both hit by the train, and off the tracks to the street down below to their deaths. Bruce witnessed it all from another body and the experience left him in rage and pain.

The police arrives at the scene and finds the bodies along with all the legal information regarding project Sabbath, exonerating Bruce Wayne from any charge. Meanwhile, at Wayne Manor, Bruce tries his best to explain Jeannie of how her brother died helping him and helping the city, but she is far too hurt to understand any reasons and she blames Bruce of everything that happened. She leaves the house, promising not to tell anyone about Batman but also with no intention of meeting Bruce ever again.

Days later, Riordan is arrested and questioned about his illegal activities and the cartel. Riordan is more that happy to comply, because of Harbinger's command of being mild and honest. When Riordan is being transferred to jail, Henri Ducard kills him with a clean shot to the head, as the cartel asked him to and then he leaves Gotham, but leaving a letter for Bruce before going away. In the letter, Ducard congratulates Bruce for having surpassed his own skills and tells him to remember an important lesson: "It's easy to become your enemy, but the trick is to ''remain yourself"''.

A few weeks later, Bruce starts his recuperation and Gordon visits him to see how he is doing. Gordon questions him about Roy being in the Batsuit. Gordon knows that Roy wasn't Batman because he saw the two of them together, and also tells him that if Batman decides to take a break for a while, he would understand.

When he finally recovers, Bruce burns the Harbinger device and destroys every evidence left behind. Alone in Wayne Manor, Bruce realizes that if Batman must survive, Bruce can't never have a normal life, and he accepts it, for justice is blind; blind as a bat.

[[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Batman]] is part of a new radio show called "The True Tales of Batman", where he tells the announcer some of his greatest stories and the actors at the radio station would recreate the stories. The executive editor of a newspaper asks his best reporter, Scoop Scanlon, to uncover Batman's real identity and so Scoop convinces Batman that he is making a series of articles about Batman in order to stop people from committing crimes. Batman agrees to be part of it and allows Scoop to go on some of their missions with [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Robin]].

However, when word about Scoop's collaboration with Batman got around the underworld, some criminals forced the executive editor and Scoop to prepare a real trap for Batman. Scoop goes to the [[GCPD Headquarters]] and asks to activate the [[Bat-Signal]] that would summon Batman. Once the hero arrives, Scoop leads him to an abandoned building while driving the [[Batmobile]]. When Batman enters the building, he is ambushed by several criminals and Scoop thinks it's all part of the setup to reveal Batman's identity, but he learns that the thugs want to kill them both. Batman and Scoop are placed on some deadly trap until they're saved by Robin, who was hiding in the truck of the Batmobile.

After escaping the trap, Batman and Robin start investigating the criminals who attacked them, while Scoop was determined to find out the truth about Batman. They are both successful. Batman and Robin learn that the criminals are using the same schemes from another radio show to perform the hits and Scoop deduces that Bruce Wayne is Batman. During the next Batman radio show, the dark knight himself decides to be the host of the show to expose the criminals' scheme, while Scoop also took the chance to tell everyone that Batman is really Bruce Wayne.

When the show is over, Batman finally exposed the criminals and the mastermind behind it all: Graves, the radio host. Before he could be taken to prison, one of the thugs shoots at Batman, but one of the actors of the show jumps in front of the bullet and allows Batman to capture the criminals. With his dying breath, the actor wants to make something for Batman and the dark knight gives the actor the [[Batsuit]] to wear in order to fool Scoop. When the reporter sees that Bruce Wayne and Batman are two different people, he gives up his manhunt.

Later the actor, who helped Bruce during a dire situation, dies and Bruce regrets the loss of a great man.

| StoryTitle1         = Batman and Catwoman: "The Autobiography of Bruce Wayne!"
| Synopsis1           = 
A few months prior to his death, [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Bruce Wayne]] wrote his memoirs and the most important chapter is the one in which he fell in love with his long-time enemy, [[Selina Kyle (Earth-Two)|Catwoman]].

One night, [[James Gordon (Earth-Two)|Commissioner Gordon]] contacted Batman after the [[Jonathan Crane (Earth-Two)|Scarecrow]] had escaped. Batman noticed that Scarecrow used some of his trademark [[Scarecrow's Fear Toxin|fear gas]] to make Gordon hallucinate and he went looking for the criminal.

However, Batman first needed to attend the wedding of an old lover, [[Linda Page (Earth-Two)|Linda Page]], who he lost because of his crusade as Batman. While meeting Linda, Bruce also recalled the other women in his life that he abandoned because of his quest and at this point, Bruce Wayne seems like nothing more but a fake front to keep the Batman alive. During the wedding, the Scarecrow attacked and Bruce was forced to go into action. In the struggle, Batman was affected by the fear toxin, but he didn't notice and he started seeing his friends disappearing, vanishing in front of him, when in reality it was all an illusion.

Batman left in a hurry, but when he couldn't contact any friend, he went for the only person he could trust, Catwoman. Together, Batman and Catwoman went looking for Scarecrow and Batman was determined to make him pay for taking away his friends and family. The two overcame a series of obstacles left by Scarecrow, but they couldn't find the crook. At this point, both of them started bonding, revealing to each other the truth about their own past. The two of them realized that they are in need of love and all they wanted is someone they could hold and embrace. This realization was cut short by Batman's reluctance to accept the truth and he became more driven to capture the Scarecrow.

When Batman and Catwoman found a dummy of Scarecrow, they activated a new brand of fear gas, which made Batman afraid of cats and Catwoman afraid of Bats. When Batman started vanishing to the eyes of Catwoman, she realized that the fear toxin created illusions according to their own fears. Since Batman was afraid of losing close people, all his friends "vanished" and now that they fear each other's theme costumes, they would disappear. Catwoman told Batman to remove their masks. When Selina took off her mask, her image became clear to Batman once again and after a long inner struggle, Bruce took off his cowl as well, baring himself to Selina. This symbolic moment strengthened their bond and they embraced each other in a loving way, overcoming their own inner demons.

He eventually found and captured Scarecrow, but the most important event of that night was the fact that he found Bruce Wayne and with him, the love of his life. Now that Selina had passed away, Bruce can only hope that people will remember him as fondly as he remembers her, filled with love and joy.

| StoryTitle1         = Batman and Robin: "Interlude on Earth-Two"
| Synopsis1           = 
During a lightning storm in [[Gotham City]] of [[Earth-Two]], [[Richard Grayson (Earth-Two)|Robin]] and [[Theodore Knight (New Earth)|Starman]] learn about the return of the long-forgotten [[Hugo Strange (Earth-Two)|Hugo Strange]], but Starman is seriously injured by a hologram of the evil professor, who then steals the [[Cosmic Staff|Cosmic Rod]] and Robin is forced to work alone.

{{Image|Batwoman Earth Two 1.jpg|Earth-Two Batwoman|100px}}
Meanwhile on [[Earth-One]], [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-One)|Batman]] has been drawn to the [[Gotham Cemetery]] without an apparent reason and when lightning strikes near him, he is transported to Earth-Two. Batman goes to the JSA Headquarters to ask Doctor Fate to return him to Earth-One, but he finds Robin instead and he learns about the return of Hugo Strange. At that moment, both heroes are attacked by the [[Batmobile]] and weapons from old enemies that were stored in the Trophy Room in the [[Batcave]]. Batman and Robin work together to destroy the vehicles and they are suddenly joined by [[Katherine Kane (Earth-Two)|Batwoman]]. The three heroes take the [[Whirly-Bat]]s from the trunk of the destroyed Batmobile and they travel to the [[Batcave]], where they expect to find Hugo Strange.

During their journey, it becomes clear that Robin resents the Batman of Earth-One for using the mantle of the original Batman. Batman on the other hand is none too pleased of being in a timeline where an older version of himself has just died, and Batwoman is concerned that her feelings for Batman will return if this younger Batman doesn't leave soon.

{{Image|Hugo Strange Earth-Two 004.jpg|Death of Hugo Strange|right}}
Upon arriving at the Batcave, the heroes are attacked by several more mechanical items in the place, so the heroes put their differences aside and work as a team to destroy the Mechanical T-Rex and one of Batman's Robots. It is then that an old and decrepit Hugo Strange appears and tells them that after his last encounter with [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-Two)|Batman]] and Robin, he was forced to live years in a catatonic state and that he recovered just recently, this is the reason why he seeks revenge. Batman deduces the truth and confronts Strange, telling him that what he really wants is to be killed for good and Strange reveals that it is precisely what he wants. Using the power of the rod, Strange turns himself into ashes until he completely disappears.

Shortly afterwards, Starman has recovered and returning to the Cemetery, he uses the Cosmic Rod to send Batman back to Earth-One. The Dark Knight bids farewell to Robin and Batwoman, who are still emotionally shocked to see Batman once again. After Batman has departed with the promise of working together again, Robin and Starman wonder what caused Batman to be on the cemetery in the first place, and as they walk in front of the tomb of Bruce Wayne, they realize there are questions better left unanswered.

| StoryTitle1         = Batman and the Huntress: "The Batman's Last Christmas!"
| Synopsis1           = 
It is Christmas Eve and [[James Gordon (Earth-One)|Commissioner Gordon]] summons [[Bruce Wayne (Earth-One)|Batman]] to inform him that the reports needed to arrest crimelord "Spurs" Sanders have been stolen. Batman goes looking for the criminal and he locates and captures the thug who stole the documents with help from the recently arrived [[Helena Wayne (Earth-Two)|Huntress]]. She tells Batman that she used the [[Justice League Teleporter]] to reach [[Earth-One]] and spend Christmas with the closest thing to a father.

Batman gladly accepts Huntress' company, but as he reads the reports he recovered, he learns that his father, [[Thomas Wayne (Earth-One)|Thomas Wayne]], could've been involved with gangsters. Bruce and Helena set out to find the truth and after interrogating Amos Randolph, Thomas Wayne's accountant, they learn that there was indeed missing money from Thomas' account. Later, Huntress and Batman go to Sanders' place and they interrogate the mobster, who in turn gives a tape with Thomas' voice, where he is clearly bankrolling Sanders' criminal activities.

The revelation is extremely hard for Bruce and he decides to end his Batman career as he believes it has all been for nothing. Helena can't help but recall the moment when her own father decided to retire from his Batman identity after her mother's death. In the upcoming days, Bruce Wayne returns to his playboy life, but when he witnesses Huntress saving the life of an innocent man, Bruce realizes that Batman stands for something much greater than vengeance.

In order to find the truth, Bruce and Helena go to [[Wayne Manor]], where Bruce recalls an important clue about Amos Randolph and he finally learns that everything is a well constructed lie. Batman goes to Randolph's place and confronts the elder man about his impersonation of Thomas Wayne and the use of his money to bankroll criminals. Randolph confesses, which is more than enough to bring peace of mind to Bruce and he leaves the elder in his own prison. Meanwhile, Huntress goes to Sunder's place and tells the crook that the truth has been discovered and that Commissioner Gordon will soon have all the evidence needed to put him behind bars.

With all settled, Bruce and Helena spend the holidays together as family and Batman's faith in his quest is restored.

| StoryTitle1         = [[Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?]] (Part 1 of 2): The Beginning of the End
| Synopsis1           = 
Batman's conscience overlooks [[Gotham City]] and a voice talks and takes his view towards [[Park Row|Crime Alley]], where something important is taking place. At that moment, the [[Catmobile]] enters the street and Selina Kyle stops the vehicle in front of a bar. When she steps down of the car, a youngster offers to keep an eye on her car for a few cents, but she replies that her car is already protected and as the young man turns around, he sees the car filled with astray cats. Selina walks into the bar, which is apparently empty except for the bar tender, who is in fact Joe Chill. Joe tells Selina to walk to the back door to reach her destination and as she starts walking there, Selina remembers that Chill was supposed to be dead, but he just tells her that he was there when it all started and that he needs to be there in the end. As Selina enters the room in the back, Alfred welcomes her and takes her to the main room, where they are waking Batman, who had just recently died.

Batman's conscience keeps watching as more people start arriving to his own funeral. Two-Face arrives and he allows the youngster to keep an eye on his vehicle. Commissioner Gordon and [[Barbara Gordon (New Earth)|Barbara]] arrive as well and Alfred places them on the seats in the front. When [[Joker (New Earth)|Joker]] arrives in his [[Jokermobile]], the youngster doesn't really wants to take care of that car, but Joker insists. The young man is left in shock as he believes he will most likely be killed by the Joker whether he takes care of the car or not.

More people keep arriving at the funeral, both Batman's greatest allies as well as his greatest foes. [[Harvey Bullock (New Earth)|Harvey Bullock]] talks to [[Renee Montoya (New Earth)|Montoya]] and he explains her that he believes that with Batman dead, Gotham City is already dead as well. Meanwhile, villains like [[Harleen Quinzel (New Earth)|Harley Quinn]], Joker, Mad Hatter and Penguin are courteously talking about their common enemy's demise. When enough guests have arrived, Dick Grayson talks to the people in the room and asks if there's anyone who would like to say anything about the departed.

Selina Kyle walks to the front and starts telling the story of how they met and her unique relation with Batman. Selina was once a thief disguised as a cat, when Batman confronted and stopped her. Their encounters would become much more regular and each time, there would be an increasing romantic tension between both of them. One night, after Batman captured her for the umpteenth time, Batman tried to talk her into going straight and be a normal person, but Selina refused, as she believed that while doing so, he wouldn't care anymore about her. Selina then tired to talk Batman into leaving crime fighting and become a normal person, but Batman couldn't even think about it. The conversation went like that, talking about possible scenarios where Batman and Selina would work together or they would both live normal lives. In the end, Selina told Batman that she would start taking down criminals, hoping to clean the city until there wasn't need for a Batman. Selina did her best and took down organized crime factions as well as known villains like Penguin. When she was taking care of a street pimp, Batman appeared and told her to stop her crusade, as she is turning into a worse criminal herself. Selina finally understands and retires from her vigilante activities, opening a pet store in which she takes care of cats. For years, she kept doing her honest job, listening to stories about the dark knight, but never actually talking to him again. Until one night, Batman appeared in front of her store just as she was closing it. He was badly injured and after losing a lot of blood, he was looking for help. Selina took him inside the store, but hours later, Batman woke up and realized that instead of giving him medical attention, Selina had tied him to a sofa, preventing him from escaping. Selina then talks how he asked her to take him to a hospital and how she refused to do it, killing Batman.

As Selina walks away from the coffin, Alfred steps forward and starts telling his own version of Batman's life and adventures. He starts telling the attendees about his past as an actor and how he was called to Gotham City once his father was diagnosed with a terminal illness. By the time Alfred arrived in Gotham, his father had died and following his will, Alfred started working as the butler for the Wayne family. Alfred witnessed the sheer happiness on the Wayne household until the night when Thomas and Martha Wayne were killed by Joe Chill, leaving young Bruce as an orphan. The shock of these events never left Bruce's mind and he began training his mind and body to the point of perfection. After years of training and preparation, Bruce, now an adult, started going to the streets as a masked vigilante to stop crime, but on his first missions, he always ended up badly injured. A short time later, Bruce started dressing as a bat and he even designed his base of operations underneath Wayne Manor. His crime-fighting skills improved as well as his general mood. However, his mission started to consume him and soon, Batman became a force too powerful for the common crime of the city. Alfred witnessed how Bruce's purpose in life started to fade away and he decided to give the man some joy back into his life. Alfred met with one of his former actor colleagues in Gotham and asked him to play the role of a criminal mastermind with a compulsion for riddles. After a few nights of planning, they came up with the Riddler's identity and a perfect criminal plot that would keep Batman distracted from the futility of his existence.{{Image|Joker 0115.jpg|Alfred, the Joker}} After their successful feat, Alfred called his other friends and asked the same of them, giving them all new criminal identities. However, Alfred noticed that Batman could defeat them all and that this hero needed a nemesis. Alfred took it upon himself to create the perfect villain for Batman. Using some special make-up, a purple suit and a green wig, Alfred turned into the Joker and would create crime plots, the best ones he could come up with and confronted Batman every once in a month or so, just to keep the idea alive. However, one night, Bruce found Alfred's equipment and using his actual detective skills, he deduced Alfred's whole charade. Alfred and Bruce discussed their future and Alfred suggested that maybe then, Bruce could give up being Batman, but Bruce replied that Gotham won't allow Batman to give up. At that moment, the [[Bat-Signal]] was activated and Bruce answered the call. Batman arrived at the Gotham Zoo, where "The Riddler" had captured several kids and the Dark Knight stepped down and confronted the man. Batman revealed to him that he already knew the truth about his plan with Alfred and his own past as an actor. However, Eddie Nash's mind was gone and he actually believed that he was The Riddler. Batman attempted to stop him, but Riddler shot Batman in the face, killing him. Alfred ends his story telling that Eddie was taken to the real mental hospital and not Arkham Asylum, which was only another part of his own made-up world.

While everyone keeps mourning the death of the Dark Knight, Batman's conscience is aware that none of what's happening makes any sense and soon the figure of a woman joins him and Batman asks if she is death. She refuses to give an straight answer and tells Batman to figure it out for himself.

Lois arrives at the cape where they are detecting the presence of UFOs around their intended flight area.  The military sends LT Carver to investigate but he passes out from the dizzy effects of zero gravity training.  Instead of notifying the authorities, Lois commandeers the rocket and takes the astronauts place as she launches into space.  When Lois arrives at the satellite site she observes members of the 100 tampering with the satellite.  They capture Lois and reveal their intention to set up an artificial magnetic field that would prevent space launches from earth.  Lois overpowers the commander of the 100 spaceship and signals for Superman's help.  The remaining  members of the 100 are captured and they return to earth on the 100s spaceship.

| StoryTitle1         = Supergirl: "The Man with the Explosive Mind!"
| Synopsis1           = [[Kara Zor-El (Earth-One)|Linda Danvers]] goes to pick her friend [[Lena Luthor (Earth-One)|Lena]] up at the train station when a sudden explosion forces her to intervene as Supergirl. Fortunately, there aren't casualties thanks to a delayed train, but Supergirl doesn't find any traces of a bomb. As she repairs the tracks, she's being watched from a distance by the mysterious saboteur. The man also detects another mind with formidable psychic powers near from Supergirl, and after scanning Lena's mind, he decides to use her against Supergirl. As Linda meets up with Lena, the saboteur boosts her telepathic powers, and Lena learns that Linda is Supergirl.

Lena decides to keep her new knowledge to herself. As both friends talk, Lena tells Linda that it's has been tough to raise her son since [[Jeffrey Colby (Earth-One)|her husband]] died and she's grateful to Linda for finding her a job as "Secret Hearts" script-writer's secretary. During the next few days, Linda helps Lena get settled into her new job and find an apartment.

Later, after Linda is done with shooting a scene where her character gets trapped in a burning building, she and Lena are attending a rock concert when the mysterious saboteur telekinetically causes a fire. Supergirl puts out the fire quickly, but the saboteur disappears.

Not long after, Supergirl is officiating over a charity marathon and saves a contestant from drowning when the saboteur blows a bridge up. Supergirl confronts the saboteur, who calls himself the [[Paige Van Horne (Earth-One)|Mind-Bomber]], and he escapes again. After seeing his telekinesis in action, Supergirl deduces he was also behind the train station explosion, and realizes his crimes are paralleling her show's latest scripts. It's like [[Gregory Gilbert (Earth-One)|Greg Gilbert]]'s scripts are predicting her encounters with the Mind-Bomber, which makes Linda afraid because the tomorrow's script includes a mass shooting, and she is supposed to dedicate a new courthouse tomorrow. Supergirl considers whether to cancel.

The next day, though, Lena. dressed as Supergirl, is taking part in the ceremony. Mind-Bomber gets so mad at his failure to scare Supergirl off that he exposes himself. The real Supergirl then lands, revealing that she knows his plan and his identity, and sent a substitute. Desperate, Mind-Bomber seizes Lena and drags her into an abandoned subway station.

Supergirl gives chase, stating she knows that he couldn't read her mind, so he tapped into Lena's, to learn her secret identity as part of seeking revenge against his own family. Lena then takes her Supergirl mask off and reveals that they figured out his identity after noticing that all of his crimes jeopardized members of the Van Horne family. Lena also figured even though he can't read Supergirl's mind he can influence her into not seeing him. Supergirl finds both of them thanks to her super-hearing and hits Mind-Bomber but he loses control of his own powers and appears to blow himself up.

As they leave the subway, both women comment that they were able to stop the villain because Lena knew Supergirl's identity. Lena has also been ghost-writing for Greg the past week, so Linda deduced that the Mind-Bomber planted the script ideas in Lena's head.

Nonetheless, Kara has several problems to deal with: the possibility of Mind-Bomber surviving, Greg's strange behavior and her old friend knowing her secret.

| StoryTitle2         = Mr. &amp; Mrs. Superman: "The Kill Kent Contract!"

| StoryTitle3         = Private Life of Clark Kent: "Search for a Secret-Seeker"
| Synopsis3           = [[Ralph Dibny (New Earth)|The Elongated Man]] pays a visit to [[Kal-El (Earth-One)|Clark Kent]], claiming he was invited over for lunch.  Clark, who has no memory of inviting him, thinks it is a ploy of an unknown person to reveal Superman's secret identity, but the truth is a little stranger.

| StoryTitle4         = Lois Lane: "Lois Lane: Hostage!"
| Synopsis4           = [[Lois Lane (Earth-One)|Lois Lane]] gets too close to terrorists looking for a story, and is taken hostage herself.

| Speaker             = [[Helena Wayne (Earth-Two)|Huntress]]

| StoryTitle1         = Be Wonder Woman... and Die
| Synopsis1           = Wonder Woman gives a wannabe actress who wishes to play her in a movie the chance to play her in real life, not knowing that the girl has only six months to live and that she will die accepted by the Amazons as one of their own. 

| StoryTitle2         = Karnage Is the Name
| Synopsis2           = Helena is in an alleyway in Gotham and is distracted thinking about Harry and the recent change in their relationship. She also  mentions Dick and him going overseas, and how her costume career seems to get in the way of her life. To her surprise an individual catches her unaware, and introduces himself as Karnage. His explicit purpose is their for her demise and greets her with a crushing bear-hug. Helena had told him others like Joker, Thinker and Thorne had tried to end her career too. Karnage states he is out to make a name for himself so he has more reason to be successful. 

Helena comments on his good grip before she does a back flip out of the hold. He is relentless and well armed with miniature missals that Helena avoids. He has a whip that reminds her of the cat of nine tails of her mother but worse. Karnage is getting the best of her with great proficiency in the use of the whip. She eventually makes an escape with the Batline and ascends to a safe and lofty perch to regroup. She reflects on tips of the trade that her dad had instilled in her. She retires to a long over due respite and hot bath. Afterwards, she goes to a hope chest and continues to wonder about her heroine career. In the chest is a chemistry set from her dad and  a doll from her mother and a teddy from Alfred. She reminisces over the first time her dad revealed his identity to her, and thoughtfully assures herself "Daddy, I love you so -- and miss you so! I won't let you down!"

Meanwhile, Charlie Karnage is talking to Stenville and with braggadocio touts his victory and the use of the weapons he was given. Stenville is not impressed, and emphatically states he wants the Huntress dead. He even tells him to kill Charlie Cranston whom Helena works with by coincidence. While at the office the next day, Helena is in a normal conversation with Charley, when Karnage breaks through the window to make good on the hit job Stenville initiated.
