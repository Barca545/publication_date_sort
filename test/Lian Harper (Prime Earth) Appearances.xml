| StoryTitle1         = Duende
| Synopsis1           = ''''' Graves, Willock and Crane Building. Gotham Financial District '''''

[[Catwoman (Selina Kyle)|Catwoman]] organizes an heist with the collaboration of [[Oswald Cobblepot (Prime Earth)|Oswald Cobblepot]], also known as underworld boss and casino owner Penguin, and [[Edward Nygma (Prime Earth)|Edward Nygma]], better known as the intelligent and crafty madman who goes by the name of Riddler. They were inside the Penguin's safe bunker, resisting to the [[The Joker War|Joker War]], but Selina never wanted to stay there. She unknowingly gave the keys to [[Joker (Prime Earth)|Joker]] which allowed him to steal all of [[Batman (Bruce Wayne)|Bruce Wayne]]'s fortune, and she needed a plan to take that fortune back. Now she will: as Nygma gets into the [[Harlan Graves (Prime Earth)|Underbroker]]'s security system and Cobblepot provides an external diversive, Selina dances through a jungle of lasers and alarms, reaching the main servers.

Then, in a risky move, she cuts out both Penguin and Riddler from the plan, making all the money Joker took from Wayne and also all the money of other criminal hid inside Graves, Willock and Crane's operations go to a secret account. She then escapes the building, outwitting the Riddler. But in the end, the Penguin takes her, shooting her in the stomach. As she is condemned, an unexpected ally comes to help: detective [[Dean Hadley (Prime Earth)|Dean Hadley]] from [[Villa Hermosa]]. Stepping inside his car, Selina is brought to Hadley's apartment, where he cures her wound, potentially lethal. After a ten-hour sleep, Selina is back on her feet. She tricks Hadley into talking about why he came to [[Gotham City|Gotham]], and escapes the building without making him notice.

''''' Fox Industries Private Airstrip, Gotham City '''''

As [[Lucas Fox (Prime Earth)|Lucas Fox]], CEO of [[Fox Industries]], steps into his car, he's welcomed by a new chauffeur: Selina Kyle. She tells him she sent all the money to an offshore account with the name of [[Lucius Fox (Prime Earth)|Lucius]] on it. It's all the money Joker stole from Bruce that the clown has not spent away already, plus money from several criminals in Gotham. It must be used to get Bruce back in business and to help the people of Gotham damaged by the war. And she also knows she will be in danger after doing this, but she does not care: it's not the first time she dances this dance.

Now she is one of the [[Alleytown Kids|Alleytown Strays]], street kids who work for [[Catwoman (Selina Kyle)|Catwoman]]. She has become a vigilante called "Cheshire Cat", wearing a mask based on the one from her dreams. She tries to take on a gang of robbers but they overpower her and almost take her mask off until Catwoman arrives to save her. Shoes is worried that Selina is mad at her for trying to fight crime alone, but Selina simply advises her not to rush to decide who she is going to be just yet.

| StoryTitle7         = Family Dinner
| Synopsis7           = [[Grace Choi (Prime Earth)|Grace Choi]] is nervous about having dinner with her [[Anissa Pierce (Prime Earth)|girlfriend's]] family, especially her father, the living legend [[Jefferson Pierce (Prime Earth)|Black Lightning]].

| StoryTitle8         = Kawaii Kalamity!

| StoryTitle10        = Perceptible
| Synopsis10          = [[Ryan Choi (Prime Earth)|Ryan Choi]] extracts an alien villain from the brain of a young man being used as a vector for a biological weapon. When he's out of his Atom identity, he plans with [[Bruce Wayne (Prime Earth)|Bruce Wayne]] how the duo can protect the Chinese community from being ignored.

| StoryTitle11        = The Monkey Prince Hates Superheroes
| Synopsis11          = [[Shazam (Billy Batson)|Shazam]] is strapped down to a table in [[Thaddeus Sivana (Prime Earth)|Doctor Sivana's]] lab. Sivana plans to cut out the hero's heart and eat it, much to the disgust of his henchman and henchwoman. Shazam correctly deduces that Sivana is possessed by a demon which he released from an ancient Yuan Dynasty gourd. Shazam breaks free and reveals that he is fact the shapeshifting [[Marcus Sun (Prime Earth)|Monkey Prince]]. Sivana's henchmen shoot at Monkey Prince but he deflects their blasts with his staff Jingu Bang, and the ricochets set off a nearby bomb. Monkey Prince carries the henchmen to safety and allows them to escape before the police arrive.

The explosion has knocked the demon out of Sivana, but unfortunately the demon is undefeated and now invisible. Monkey Prince's mentor [[Zhu Bajie (Prime Earth)|Shifu Pigsy]] appears and blows Powdered Immortal Eye in his face, allowing him to see the demon, a deer spirit. While Monkey Prince fights the deer spirit, the real Shazam arrives to Monkey Prince's annoyance. Shazam and Sivana fight while Monkey Prince battles the demon, much to their confusion as to them he appears to be fighting empty air. The demon attacks Shazam, allowing Sivana to escape, and Monkey Prince destroys it while it is distracted. Shazam accuses Monkey Prince of being in league with Sivana and Monkey Prince, who already dislikes superheroes, is outraged. As he grows angry, his powers spike and he blasts Shazam away with a gust of wind. To prevent Monkey Prince causing mass destruction, Pigsy activates his "discipline device", a constricting band around Money Prince's head. In pain, Monkey Prince runs away, reverting to human form.

Monkey Prince, whose real name is Marcus, goes home to his beloved adoptive parents, who are revealed to be Sivana's henchmen. The next morning Marcus goes to Fawcett High School where he meets up with his only friend, Billy Batson. Billy is excited to show Marcus a clip of Shazam from the previous night, but Marcus is not interested, saying "Superheroes suck".

| StoryTitle1         = "Infinite Lies"
| Synopsis1           = On Earth 0, Cameron Chase goes to the Hall of Justice to speak to Superman and Batman. She tells them that after the latest Crisis people are afraid, and not content to just trust the heroes will take care of it. An alarm cuts the conversation short and Superman carries Cameron out of the Hall and flies away at superspeed before she can react. Director Bones calls her and tells her to contact the recently returned Captain Atom and recruit him to the D.E.O..

Meanwhile, Justice Incarnate are gathering the pieces of the interdimensional prison ship which Thomas Wayne escaped from. The ship somehow crashed and the debris was scattered across the Multiverse. Wayne remembers being abducted from Arkham Asylum on Earth 0 by X-Tract and managing to fight his way to an escape shuttle, but he doesn't know what happened after that. Harbinger alerts him and President Superman that a large chunk of the ship has been detected on Earth 22, but their contact is not responding. The two head to Earth 22 and are attacked by Magog, who was previously reformed but appears to have been reverted to villainy by the recreation of the Multiverse.

Back on Earth 0, Alan Scott has called in the Totality for help after his daughter's disappearance. Mister Terrific tells Obsidian that many people associated with the JSA or Infinity, Inc. have mysteriously disappeared, something the Totality have been keeping secret from the superhero community. Todd is frustrated by the lack of action and insists on interrogating their old enemy Vandal Savage, who rudely tells Alan to get rid of Todd as he is not part of the Totality. Angered, Alan blasts Savage away and resigns from the Totality, and father and son head off to look for Jennie.

Meanwhile, Roy Harper is trying to figure out how to use his new Black Lantern ring. Remembering some advice Hal Jordan gave him when he was a child, Roy activates the ring and flies into the air. He creates a construct of a bow and some targets shaped like his old enemies and practices his aim, annoyed that one of his shots is slightly off the bullseye. He asks the ring why he was chosen, and in response it creates a huge energy construct, showing the faces of Darkseid, the alternate Thomas Wayne, Barry Allen, Psycho-Pirate and Lian Harper. However the construct shows Lian as a teenager, when she supposedly died as a young child. Roy realises Lian is alive and demands the ring tell him where she is, but suddenly he hears Darkseid's voice in his mind and the ring takes control of him. His face changes to the typical corpselike appearance of a Black Lantern and the Corps symbol on his chest transforms into an Omega, and he flies off to answer Darkseid's call.

At Metropolis Air Force Base, Chase meets with Captain Atom and asks him how he is alive, when he supposedly died during the events of ''Death Metal''. Atom claims to have been restored to life when the Multiverse was remade and declines her offer to join the D.E.O, as he has decided to retire. Chase appeals to him based on their history together, although they have never met before. He reminisces with her about a supposed mission they went on that never actually happened, confirming her suspicions that he is an alternate version of Captain Atom from another reality. When she confronts him he reveals that he is trying to hide out from Darkseid on Earth 0, and now that he has been found he breaches his own containment skin, creating a nuclear explosion that seemingly kills them both.

*Roy's [[Speedy]] flashback implies that, as a consequence of the [[Dark Nights: Death Metal Vol 1 6|''unknotting'' of the timeline]], Oliver and Dinah have been a couple since their early years, like in the [[Pre-Flashpoint]] [[New Earth|timeline]], while in the [[Post-Flashpoint]] continuity they became engaged only in the [[DC Rebirth|Rebirth]] era.
**Furthermore, it is implied that the events of [[Green Lantern/Green Arrow Vol 1|Green Lantern/Green Arrow]] have also been restored to the continuity.

| StoryTitle1         = "Infinite Incorporated"
| Synopsis1           = Green Lantern and Obsidian have broken off from the Totality and are searching for Jade the proactive way, hunting down each of Alan's old enemies in turn and beating them up for information. The eventually make their way to the reformed Shade, who suggests that one of Todd and Jennie's enemies may be responsible.

Meanwhile, the possessed Roy Harper is flying into space in answer to Darkseid's call. His desire to find his daughter allows him to break the ring's control, but he is left stranded in orbit. If he uses his ring to get back to Earth it will possess him again, so he decides to simply wait for a cosmic hero to pass by and pick him up. He is quickly located by a spaceship which takes him on board.

On Earth 22, President Superman and the Flashpoint Batman are attacked by Magog when they try to investigate the crashed ship. Superman assumes Magog has reverted to villainy, but Magog states he simply wants to keep dangers from the multiverse off his world. The rest of Justice Incarnate arrives to provide backup, but Superman orders them to stand down before the fight can escalate and tells Magog they simply want to investigate the wreck and leave, which he agrees to. Batman remembers how Barry Allen told him that every parallel world had it's own vibrational frequency, and suggests the wreckage may react to something from its own world. The heroes each place their hands on the wreck and it vibrates where Superman touches it, indicating the ship is originally from Earth 23.

On Earth Omega, Barry believes he has entered the Speed Force and is racing to save the Multiverse, but this is an illusion created by the Psycho-Pirate, he is in fact spinning a gigantic turbine. In the distance he sees a running figure begging for help and speeds up to reach them.

Back on Earth 0, Alan and Todd sneak into DEO bunker Command D, as Todd suspects Director Bones may be involved. He confesses to his father that he has always felt overshadowed by Jade, who was more confident and a natural leader, while he always struggled with interpersonal relationships, however since he found his partner Damon he has found it easier to connect to people. He also tells Alan that Damon has a friend he would like to set Alan up with, but Alan believes he is too old to start dating and is still not over his lost love Jimmy Henton.

They spot Bones and realise Todd's hunch was correct. Bones is supervising the construction of a âCarrier Arkâ, a huge flying prison ship. Green Lantern and Obsidian are attacked by X-Tract, who is working for the DEO. They fight off her and her henchmen, but are shot by Cameron Chase, who is somehow alive.

The ship which picked up Roy is revealed to be another Carrier Ark, under the command of âAgent Hammondâ. Hammond tells Roy that the DEO's mandate has been expanded to deal with interdimensional invaders and people back from the dead. DEO agents attack Roy with sonic weapons which prevent him focusing to use his ring. Roy suddenly realises that Agent Hammond is Hal Jordan's old enemy Hector Hammond, restored to normal by the changes to reality. Hammond takes the ship into the Bleed, telling Roy the DEO have made a deal with someone to hand him and his ring over.

Suddenly the ship begins rocking with impacts, and Hammond realises that they are being attacked by something within the Bleed, which should be impossible. The agents restraining Roy are distracted and he uses his ring to overpower them, creating a construct of Hal to punch Hammond in the face. Unfortunately, the ring starts to possess him again and the attackers, a team of JSA members led by Jade, burst up through the floor. They assume Roy is a zombie from an alternate world in the Omniverse and attack him.

* The Daily Planet website confirms that the events from {{c|Infinite Frontier Vol 1 1}} to this issue take place in late May/early June [[2021]] and, as a consequence, [[Infinite Frontier Vol 1 0|issue #0]] take place in early May.
* As a consequence of the rebirth of the Multiverse, Hector Hemmond has been restored on [[Prime Earth]] without his metahuman abilities.
| Trivia              = 
* At the end of the issue, there is an epilogue which shows [[Robert Todd (Prime Earth)|Mister Bones]] monitoring events from Earth 0 and their related questions, which are both references and previews to current DC comics storylines, including:
** [[Michael Carter (Prime Earth)|Booster Gold]] and [[Theodore Kord (Prime Earth)|Blue Beetle/Ted Kord]]'s forming [[Blue &amp; Gold Restoration]] in {{c|Blue &amp; Gold Vol 1 1}};
** Barry Allen's disappearance in {{c|Infinite Frontier Vol 1 1}};
** [[Amanda Waller (Prime Earth)|Amanda Waller]]'s metahuman hunt through the realities from {{v|Suicide Squad Vol 7}};
** President Superman's search for the origins of the fallen spaceship from this volume;
** [[League of Lazarus (Prime Earth)|League of Lazarus]]'s fight tournament from {{v|Robin Vol 3}};
** The rise of [[Jace Fox (Prime Earth)|Batman/Tim Fox]] in {{v|I Am Batman Vol 1}}.
* Magog saying that "''the Multiverse has always caused tragedy''" on [[Earth 22]] foreshadows the events of ''{{c|Batman/Superman: World's Finest Vol 1 20}}{{c|Batman/Superman: World's Finest Vol 1 24|-24}}'' where the real identity and the Post-Flashpoint origins of [[Earth 22]] Magog are eventually revealed.
* Psycho Pirate mentions Barry Allen being the first person into the [[Multiverse]] to travel between the realities which happened back in {{c|The Flash Vol 1 123}}.
* Upon seeing Black Lantern Roy, Jade speculates about a "''zombie world''" which is an indirect reference to  [[Earth 55]], the setting of {{v|DCeased Vol 1}} and its sequels.

| StoryTitle1         = "Infinite Evil"
| Synopsis1           = Darkseid has offered various people around the Multiverse a deal: if they align with him, he will protect their worlds from the coming Crisis. Director Bones agreed to hand over heroes on Earth 0 who originally come from other realities so Darkseid can harness their multiversal energy, while the members of Injustice Incarnate will serve as soldiers.

On Earth Omega, everyone emerges from the crashed Carrier Arks and reunites. X-Tract tells them that they are stranded without the Carrier Arks, and reveals she is the Cameron Chase of the original Earth-Two. They see Barry Allen running in the turbine and when Green Lantern asks X-Tract what is happening, the Psycho-Pirate appears and explains that they will use Barry, the first person to ever cross from one world to another, to crack open the Multiverse, allowing Darkseid access to the power beyond. He opens a portal to summon Injustice Incarnate, along with the imprisoned members of Justice Incarnate, and the two sides battle.

The villains overpower the heroes until President Superman breaks free of his chains and flies towards the turbine. He is stopped by Machinehead, who tells him that Earth 0 is a danger to the multiverse, as every Crisis originates there. He attacks Superman with his one weakness, Meta-Nite, and reveals that the Flashpoint not only affected the history of Earth 0, but also damaged Earth 8. As such, he personally wants revenge against Barry and Thomas Wayne.

Chains of dark energy emerge from the planet's surface, binding the heroes and stretching into space as the other Earths of the multiverse appear in the sky. With them, Darkseid will seal all worlds off from each other, and the multiverse will slow to a state of entropy. Psycho-Pirate offers Roy Harper a deal, if he surrenders to the ring and joins Darkseid, they will leave Earth 0 alone and Lian will be safe. Roy realises that Lian is not on Earth Omega as he assumed and uses the ring to free the other heroes. He asks them all to save the Multiverse and Lian as the ring takes control. They attack the Psycho-Pirate, but Darkseid emerges from a Boom Tube, telling them that with Roy under his control, he now commands all reality.

| Notes               = 
* Machinehead acknowledges the Flashpoint creating the cracks in the fabric of reality which supposedly caused the ''[[War in Secret]]'' he mentioned in the previous issue.
* This story reveals that X-Tract is the actually the [[Cameron Chase]] of the Pre-Crisis [[Earth-Two]] who was brought to [[Prime Earth|Earth 0]] after the [[Dark Nights: Death Metal Vol 1 7|rebirth of Creation]].
** She never appeared in the [[Pre-Crisis]] continuity.
| Trivia              = 
* There are multiple references and flashbacks to past events from the DC history:
** Psycho-Pirate reminsices [[Earth-Two]] [[Crisis on Infinite Earths Vol 1 11|being merged]] into [[New Earth]] during the [[First Crisis]] and refers to himself as the only one to remember the reality changes due to the various Crises;
*** Psycho-Pirate repeats once again that Barry's Earth-One [[Barry Allen (New Earth)|counterpart]] was [[The Flash Vol 1 123|the first one to travel to another universe]];
*** He also states that, before Barry's first journey, Multiversal travel was difficult which is a reference to [[Earth-Two]] [[Diana of Paradise Island (Earth-Two)|Wonder Woman]] meeting her [[Earth-59]] [[Tara Terruna (Earth-59)|self]] in {{c|Wonder Woman Vol 1 59}};
** Machinehead reminisces [[New Earth]] Barry Allen [[Flashpoint Vol 2 5|creating]] the [[Flashpoint Timeline]] after going back in time to save his [[Nora Thompson (New Earth)|mother]];
** Power-Girl references Black Adam [[Infinite Crisis Vol 1 6|punching the Psycho-Pirate to death]] during the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'';
** While speaking to Roy Harper, Psycho-Pirate references many events from the hero's past, including his drug addiction and the relationship with the villain [[Cheshire]];
** Psycho-Pirate remembers the Batman who Laughs [[Prime Earth#Dark Nights: Death Metal|recreating Earth 0 in his image]] and a [[Black Lantern Ring]]-powered Batman resurrecting the dead heroes, including Roy Harper, before the final battle against the [[Dark Multiverse]]/[[Last 52 Multiverse]] army in {{c|Dark Nights: Death Metal Vol 1 5}}.
* The cracks in reality mentioned by Machinehead are the same ones that, years later, [[Jonathan Osterman (Watchmen)|Doctor Manhattan]] [[Flash Forward (Collected)|tried to fix]] before his [[Doomsday Clock Vol 1 12|disappearance]].
* The scene where President Superman frees himself from the chains references the cover of {{c|Superman Vol 1 233}}.

| StoryTitle1         = Fear State 1: Street Thunder
| Synopsis1           = Taking place shortly after the events of Catwoman 34, Selina returns to her home, "The Nest", to find Lieutenant James Rigs investigating the spot where Detective Dean Hadley was shot and murdered by an automated sniper rifle set up by Karl Valley. Selina explains the bullet was meant for her sister while she would be forced to watch her die. 
Rigs explains how they searched the rubble of the explosion aftermath from the events Catwoman 34, but found no traces of Karl Valley, not realizing that Valley himself was disguised as a firefighter during the search efforts. 
As a result of these events, Selina sends her sister Maggie out of Gotham to safety on a nearby boat. 

Meanwhile in Alleytown, Clayface forms an alliance of heroes between old villains Firefly, Killer Croc, Cheshire and Knockout as an opportunity to atone for their past misdeeds by assisting Catwoman in destroying the recent oppressive Magistrate occupation of Alleytown. It is their hope that after helping, they may be allowed to call Alleytown home if they prove victorious. 

Back at 'The Nest', Selina receives the warning on her phone from the hacked Oracle (see Fear State Alpha and Batman #112), stating Batman is dead. Leo tells Selina to go into Gotham to investigate and verify the message authenticity. She takes a motorcycle rigged with timed explosives and leaves for Gotham.

At a nearby safehouse, The Penguin speaks with Riddler about an opportunity to take over the Alleytown docks, stating the "Bat-lings" are occupied with a city falling apart and the Magistrate is occupied within the city itself. Penguin explains that Poison Ivy is also a key piece of Simon Saint's drugs and is currently located in subterranean Alleytown. Taking over Alleytown would mean they have control of her and the key piece of evidence likely to sink Saint Industries, linking them to the recent Cheerdrops drugs in Gotham and the framed Unsanity Collective distributors. 

Upon arriving in Gotham, Selina is immediately ambushed by Magistrate soldiers. She runs away to a nearby alley detonating the explosives beneath the motorcycle and takes a out a majority of the Magistrate soldiers. There, she meets with Cheshire Cat who tells Selina the current Oracle giving messages is an imposter and that the real Oracle is giving orders via a specified frequency on a local radio network. The real Oracle broadcasts that Alleytown is set to be shut down for good by an oncoming large force of Magistrate cybers and soldiers, and that help is on the way. 

Meanwhile, Harley Quinn and the Gardener are shown walking into Alleytown.

| StoryTitle1         = An Unusual Suspect
| Synopsis1           = After the events of [[Fear State]], Catwoman decides to give up her "kingdom" in Alleytown. She gifts The Nest to the Strays and then turns herself in to the police. Selina gives a false but plausible accounting of the battle for Alleytown which absolves her of any crimes, then escapes and frames Detective Kollak for her kidnapping with Clayface's help.

Meanwhile, Cheshire seemingly recognises Shoes as Lian and approaches her without her mask, introducing herself as "Jade". Shoes appears to subconsciously recognise her as the woman from her dream and nervously replies "Nice to meet you".

| StoryTitle1         = Reunion, Part 1
| Synopsis1           = During the Dark Crisis, Oliver Queen attempts to jump from Multiverse-2 to Earth 0 with the Justice League, but instead wakes up alone on a beach on an alien world.

Months later, Black Canary and Arsenal, along with Oliver's estranged son Connor Hawke who they met during the battle at the Hall of Justice, are searching for him. Mister Terrific assures them that Oliver did leave the ruins of Multiverse-2 with the others but was somehow diverted to another location. Following a lead from Red Hood they chase down a gang of unemployed henchmen into Gotham's Alleytown neighbourhood. Team Arrow easily overpower the petty crooks but one tries to get away. Just as Roy is about to shoot him, local vigilante Cheshire Cat leaps down from above and knocks him unconscious; then picks up a discarded arrow and throws it at another henchman who was about to shoot Team Arrow from behind, hitting him hard enough to lodge the arrow in his shoulder and knock him to the ground.

Cheshire Cat tries to leave quickly, but Roy reveals that they know she is his daughter Lian Harper. Lian tries to deny it but Roy keeps telling her details of her childhood. Roy tells Lian he doesn't know or care how she came back from the dead; and that it's alright if she isn't ready to come home yet, but she can whenever she wants. After a moment's hesitation Lian takes off her mask and runs to hug him. They all tearfully reunite and Roy asks her why she didn't come back when he learned who she was. Lian tells him that "they" will never let their family be together and suddenly she and Connor start to teleport away. Lian doesn't appear to be surprised and tells Roy to find Amanda Waller as he grabs for her. They disappear and Roy picks up her discarded mask. He furiously asks where Amanda Waller is.

Lian rematerialises in a futuristic city on the alien world. She is confronted by a Manhunter, but it is quickly destroyed by Oliver Queen. They flee from a Manhunter squad, and to Lian's surprise Oliver reveals that he knows who she is, and claims that he knew she was coming. He leads her to a chamber with a teleporter in it, and tells her that it brought them both to where they are. He destroys it and Lian yells at him that they could have used it to go home, but Oliver tells her they never can.

| StoryTitle1         = Far From Home
| Synopsis1           = Arsenal arms up for an assault on Belle Reve. He expects Black Canary to try and talk him out of it but she is fully on board.

Meanwhile on the alien world, Oliver has resumed acting as a vigilante. He chases a drug dealer to the nightclub that a local crime boss operates out of and warns the man that he will keep coming after him as long as he profits off the pain of others. Oliver easily fights off the man's henchmen and he announces a bounty on Oliver's head. A Tamaranean named Troublemaker takes the deal and attacks Oliver. She recognises him as a member of the Justice League and asks him how he ended up so far from home; but he refuses to tell her and she overpowers him. Before she can kill him, Lian arrives to save him, despite him telling her to stay behind. They fight Toublemaker together and Lian eventually knocks her out with a boxing glove arrow, but only after Oliver breaks his bow over Toublemaker's head.

They return to their shelter, and over dinner Lian asks Oliver why they can't go home; but he refuses to say. She tells him it feels like there is a supernatural force keeping their family apart and Oliver says that's for the best; but then has a sudden burst of anger. He apologises to Lian and admits that he misses his family; listing Roy, Emiko and Dinah. Lian asks him about Connor and Oliver seems confused, not recognising his name until Lian tells him that Connor is his son. Oliver's memories of Connor suddenly come flooding back and he is enraged again, saying that "they" took his son from him. Suddenly, the two of them teleport away again.

Back on Earth, Arsenal and Black Canary fight their way into Belle Reve looking for Amanda Waller. Count Vertigo, one of the prisoners, tells them that he knows secrets not only about Waller, but about them. Roy asks him what he knows, but before Vertigo can answer Peacemaker and Peacewrecker burst in and fire on them.

| StoryTitle1         = Shoot to the Future
| Synopsis1           = Oliver and Lian materialise in mid-air above a futuristic city and fall towards the ground. Oliver manages to slow their fall with a grappling hook and they land mostly unscathed. They are met by Connor and the Legion of Super-Heroes, revealing that they are on Earth in the 31st Century. Connor tells them that the Legion tracked their biometric readings and the teleporter signature to locate them and teleport them through time and space to their location. Oliver ignores the Legion and walks over to hug Connor. He tells Connor he is sorry for everything, but Connor tells him they have plenty of time to catch up, revealing that he has been in the future for months.

Back in the present, Arsenal and Black Canary battle Peacemaker and Peacewrecker. Peacemaker accidentally shoots the control panel outside Count Vertigo's cell, opening the door and deactivating his power-suppression collar. He unleashes his vertigo effect on all four of them until Black Canary knocks him down with the Canary Cry. They recover and Peacemaker offers Roy, considered the world's greatest marksman, a deal: if he can beat Peacemaker in a shooting contest, Smith will allow him to interrogate Vertigo; if he fails, he and Canary must leave. Roy agrees, despite both their female teammates telling them it is a stupid idea. Roy wins easily and orders Vertigo to tell him what he knows. Vertigo tells them that Waller is up to something big and has been gathering powerful objects, but he doesn't know where she is.

At Legion headquarters in the future, Lian tells Oliver and Connor what happened to her after she "died". She woke up in a lab with Amanda Waller and a mysterious archer; the two were arguing as Waller worried they were taking too big a risk but the archer insisted that Team Arrow could never be together. Lian then teleported away and spent years uncontrollably teleporting across time and space. She repeatedly tried to reunite with Roy, but every time she got close she teleported away again. She eventually gave up and settled in Alleytown, trying to forget her old life, until Roy found her and she was transported away again. Brainiac 5 scans her and Oliver and informs them that they, as well as Connor, have teleportation devices implanted in their necks like the Suicide Squad's bombs, obviously implanted by Waller. He also says he can't remove the devices because he doesn't know what triggers the displacement and he has no way of determining where they would end up if he accidentally set it off.

Brainiac shows them a "dark energy teleporter" like the one Oliver destroyed on the alien world, and was found near Connor when he arrived in the future. Oliver says he knows what it is, and tells Lian he believes that the archer she saw talking to Waller was him. He touches the teleporter, triggering a video message from an elderly version of himself from the future. The future Ollie tells his younger self that in his timeline a "Great Disaster" killed billions of people, and Team Arrow were responsible. He tells Oliver that their family need to stay apart, and he can never go home. The present-day Oliver tells the others that they can't return to their own time and that is why he destroyed the other teleporter. 

Lian refuses to believe it and tells him they can beat whatever is coming together. After a moment, Oliver says she is right and they should go home, when suddenly a giant green energy construct smashes through the wall. The construct easily restrains the Legion, Connor and Lian; and a bubble surrounds Oliver and pulls him into space. The bubble opens and Oliver points his bow at the person generating it, who is revealed to be Hal Jordan as Parallax.

| Notes               = 
* This comic confirms that the events of [[Justice League: Cry for Justice]] and [[The Final Night]] have been retroactively incorporated into the history of [[Prime Earth|Earth 0]] following the "unknotting" of the timeline as well as revealing Lian Harper's background history after the [[Dark Nights: Death Metal Vol 1 7|rebirth of the Multiverse]].
** This story appears to contradict {{c|DC Festival of Heroes: The Asian Superhero Celebration Vol 1 1}}, which asserted that "Shoes" had amnesia and was unaware of her true identity.
* Team Arrow being involved with the Great Disaster is similar to Ray Palmer's in [[Countdown to Final Crisis]]
| Trivia              = 
* Oliver Queen reminisces having already been in the [[31st Century]] during the events of {{v|Justice League vs. the Legion of Super-Heroes Vol 1}}.

| Synopsis1           = [[Oliver Queen (Earth-Two)|Green Arrow (Oliver Queen)]] and [[Roy Harper (Earth-Two)|Speedy (Roy Harper)]] watch from a rooftop as The Disappearing Bandit steals from yet another bank, as they attempt to give chase, they discover the bandit has escaped without a trace.

A week later, Roy notices the Green Arrow Signal has been launched into the sky, and alerts Oliver. As they race towards the crime in the [[Arrowcar]], The Disappearing Bandit manages to evade them once more, despite running into a dead-end alleyway. Seeing how frustrated Roy has become, Oliver pulls out all the stops, introducing him to every [[Trick Arrows|trick arrow]] they have.

When The Disappearing Bandit returns, Oliver and Roy are prepared, using every arrow they can to try and stop him. Roy believes the criminal got away once more, before Oliver points out that his Acrylic Arrow has showered the seemingly invisible man with paint, revealing his location. Speedy handcuffs the bandit, helping Green Arrow frogmarch him away, though neither notice the criminal hide a discarded arrow up his sleeve.

While behind bars, The Disappearing Bandit makes a deal with the mob to ensure his release; his freedom in return for the arrow he stole, and Green Arrow's fingerprints along with it. However, when he goes to show off his stolen goods, he finds the box empty. Oliver reveals to Roy that he recently gave all their arrows the unique ability to disappear, inspired by their latest rogue, impressing his ward.

| StoryTitle2         = Punching Evil
| Synopsis2           = [[Oliver Queen (New Earth)|Green Arrow (Oliver Queen)]] enters a boxing ring with [[Ted Grant (New Earth)|Wildcat (Ted Grant)]], who instructs him to put on some boxing gloves. Oliver explains he's not really sure he needs to be there, before seeing [[Bruce Wayne (New Earth)|Batman]] leave the gym, which changes his mind. Twenty minutes later Oliver is sweating and in pain, while Ted stands unaffected. [[Dinah Laurel Lance (New Earth)|Black Canary (Dinah Lance)]] arrives to watch the two fight, and chastises Ollie when he gets distracted by her, leading Ted to land a gut punch. She thanks Ted for training Oliver as a favor to her, revealing him to Ollie as the hero Wildcat.

After two months of training, Oliver remains discouraged, and believes he should stick to long-distance fighting with his bow and arrows. To teach a lesson, Ted takes his quiver and snaps his arrows clean in half, leaving him truly defenceless. Ted explains that Dinah wants Ollie to be able to defend himself at any distance, which Oliver takes to heart, wanting to be able to fight by her side.

Oliver hears a sudden buzz from above, and puts on his mask just before the roof explodes above them. [[Yellow Wasp (New Earth)|Yellow Wasp]] descends upon the two, shooting Wildcat directly in the head, killing him. Oliver attempts to grab one of his broken arrows, but Wasp punches him across the face. With his job done, Yellow Wasp tries to leave through the hole in the roof, but Ollie isn't done. He jams the end of his arrow into a boxing glove and takes aim, knocking Wasp out with a well placed shot from below.

Ted congratulates Oliver on his first knockout, surprising Ollie, who believed the man to be dead. Ted explains he has nine lives, though is now down to six, and thanks him for taking out Yellow Wasp. He then hands Ollie his newly created Boxing Glove Arrow, and encourages him to keep fighting.

| Speaker             = [[Oliver Queen (Prime Earth)|Green Arrow (Oliver Queen)]]

| StoryTitle1         = Quiver Hour
| Synopsis1           = Parallax teleports himself and Green Arrow away and shows Oliver a vision of him shooting Hal Jordan at the culmination of Zero Hour. He says that Oliver ruined all his plans to truly fix things but Oliver replies that he's not ashamed of what he did and would do it again. Green Arrow says that he knows Parallax is not the Hal Jordan of his world, but is a escapee from the previous Multiverse, which Parallax admits is true. He tells Oliver that he took refuge in the future, until Ollie's future self asked for his help setting up the system that keeps Team Arrow apart. Oliver demands to see his family and Parallax seemingly teleports them to Star City in the 21st Century, where Arsenal and Black Canary are about to enter a bar. However, when Oliver tries to hug Black Canary he discovers that he is merely a projection, and that they cannot see, hear or touch him.

The bar is The Brick House, a club owned by the crimelord Brick and frequented by mid-level supervillains. Roy is confident they will be able to find Waller's "help" in the bar. Dinah asks who they're looking for but Roy replies that the target will find them. Brick himself confronts the two heroes for coming into his bar and the patrons close in on them, but Roy is unconcerned. Suddenly the lights go out, and when they come back on everyone but Dinah and Roy is unconscious. Cheshire is revealed to be the one who knocked out the patrons and launches herself at the two heroes, but Roy tells Jade he knows she's not going to hurt him and asks her to help him find Amanda Waller. Cheshire refuses to help, until he tells her that Lian is in danger.

Back in the 31st Century Lian asks Brainaic 5 if he can track Parallax's energy signature and Brainaic says that he can, but they can't follow because time travel is illegal in their time. Frustrated, Lian asks if what the recording of the older Oliver said was true and her family really was responsible for the Great Disaster, but Saturn Girl replies they can't give her any details of the future. Lian accuses the Legion of never actually doing anything and Brainaic tells her the Oliver Queen dies a hero protecting his family. Lian points out that whoever is behind what has happened to the Arrow family has been meddling with time and therefore they are breaking the laws the Legion is supposed to uphold then they should try to catch them.

Parallax takes Green Arrow to the ruins of Star City at some point in the near future, but he refuses to tell him exactly what year they are in. He says that this is the timeline his older self is trying to avert and what will happen if he keeps trying to get back to his family. Oliver challenges Parallax to a fistfight with no powers or weapons; if he wins, then Parallax will explain everything and take him home, but if Parallax wins he can leave Oliver trapped in the future forever. Parallax agrees and the two brawl through the ruins. When Oliver starts to win, Parallax reactivates his powers and teleports away. Suddenly, the older version of Oliver emerges from a nearby building aiming an arrow at him, and says he shouldn't be there.

| Notes               = 
* The Parallax from this story is the pre-[[Zero Hour]] version of the character that was extracted from the timeline during ''[[Convergence]]'' and was displaced to the Post-[[Flash: Flashpoint|Flashpoint]] Multiverse in {{v|Telos Vol 1}}. Oliver Queen also references Parallax's clash against [[Hal Jordan (Prime Earth)|Hal Jordan]] from ''{{c|Green Lantern Vol 5 47|Green Lantern #47-}}{{c|Green Lantern Vol 4 50|50}}''.
| Trivia              = 
* The title of this issue is also a play on the [[Zero Hour]] which featured Parallax as its main villain.

| StoryTitle1         = Out of Time
| Synopsis1           = In the 31st Century, Brainiac 5 is able to track Green Arrow using the dark energy time machine, but warns Connor and Lian that only one of them can go. Connor tells Lian to stay with the Legion and he will go and save Oliver.

In the post-apocalyptic future, Oliver and his future self flee from Lizard-Men bikers in the older Oliver's car. He drives them off a cliff and reveals the car can fly. They fly to the ruined Arrowcave and the older Oliver tells them they need to talk, but the present day Oliver can tell he is hiding something.

In the present, Arsenal and Cheshire argue about Cheshire's decision to keep the fact that Lian was alive from him. They almost come to blows when Cheshire blames Roy for Lian "dying" in the first place, but Black Canary breaks it up and asks Cheshire what Waller is up to. Cheshire tells them that Waller is making deals and compromises that Cheshire never thought she would, and is preparing for something bigger than the superheroes are ready for. She tells them that she will help them find Lian, but warns Roy that if he ever cared about her he will stay away from Amanda Waller. 

In the future Oliver looks over the ruined Arrowcave, and the preserved costumes of Team Arrow. He asks his future self if he really is responsible for their deaths and the state of the world, and the older Oliver said he did everything he could. They argue, with Oliver telling his future self that he didn't do enough and he would have died trying to save their family. The older Oliver tells him that the truth was he was always destined to be alone and should never have left the island, and that's why they were always so afraid of it and never went back. He unveils the time machine and tells his younger self that he will send him anywhere in time and space he wants, but he can never be with his family. 

Suddenly, Oliver shoots the other man through the eye. He tells him that he goes back to the island whenever he needs to clear his head and get perspective, but has never told anyone. The older Oliver is revealed to have a cybernetic eye and Oliver attacks him. The impostor admits that everything that has happened has been part of an elaborate scheme to make him miserable and alone. Oliver asks him who he is and the impostor replies "your worst enemy" and pushes him into the time machine. 

Oliver appears on a rooftop in Star City, when suddenly another version of him swoops in. He recognises the other Green Arrow as himself from shortly after he returned from the dead, due to the white feather in his cap. He confirms that the other Green Arrow is not a robot and tells him that he is from the future and someone is trying to keep them from their family. A mob of other versions of him from different points in his life swarm the rooftop, declaring that the "last Green Arrow standing wins". The Green Arrows all brawl until the one with the white feather shoots the present-day version of Oliver in the chest and throws him off the building.

| StoryTitle1         = Homecoming
| Synopsis1           = In the present day, Black Canary and Arsenal split up, as Canary believes she has a lead on where Green Arrow may end up, leaving Arsenal to continue the search for Amanda Waller with Cheshire. Canary tells Arsenal to stay in contact with Oracle and not to trust Cheshire, but after Canary leaves Jade tells Roy that he will need to trust her if they are going to survive.

Oliver Queen falls through time, his life flashing before his eyes; when he suddenly emerges at a circus, which he remembers visiting a few months after he first got off the island. The arrow in his chest disappears and the wound miraculously heals. The impostor appears behind him and tells Oliver that he will hound and fight him through all of reality now that he knows the truth, but Oliver says he is done with this. He grabs a taser arrow from the impostor's quiver and uses it to short out the device in his neck. By doing this he catapults himself into the Timestream, and grabs the impostor to take him with him. The impostor yells that, with the device destroyed, they are trapped.

The impostor reveals his true identity: the presumed dead Malcolm Merlyn, alive but heavily scarred and with extensive cybernetics. As they cannot escape the Timestream, he decides to just murder Oliver while he is still incapacitated by the taser. Just as he is about to shoot Oliver he is knocked off his feet by an explosive arrow, fired by Connor Hawke. Connor tells Oliver they need to leave immediately, and Merlyn smugly tells Oliver that he will eventually escape the Timestream and come back to hurt Oliver's family when he least expects him. Oliver grabs Connor's bow and decides to kill Merlyn once and for all, but Connor asks him to spare Merlyn's life, and after a moment's hesitation Oliver agrees. Merlyn shoots at them and Connor dives in front of the arrow to save Oliver, but Lian also swoops in and catches it. The three of them exit the Timestream together, leaving Merlyn stranded outside time.

Oliver wakes up on a beach and assumes he's been left alone again, but then sees Black Canary on the beach. They run to each other and kiss, and Lian and Connor walk out of the jungle to join them. Canary reveals they're on Starfish Island and she has a plane to take them home. Lian suddenly realises Roy isn't with them and asks where her dad is.

Elsewhere, Cheshire leads Arsenal to one of Amanda Waller's safehouses where she keeps the "Network", a Dark Web information-gathering apparatus that they can use to track Lian. When they find the Network however, Roy notices that the technology doesn't look like Waller's usual equipment and realises that she is monitoring every superhero on Earth. They hear a click and Cheshire pushes Roy out of the way of a hail of bullets and is shot. Roy turns to face their attacker but is gunned down himself. Their attackers are revealed to be Waller, Peacemaker and Peacewrecker.

| Synopsis1           =Oliver and his son Connor (both in their Green Arrow costumes) find themselves in Star City, a city in chaos after Beast Boy loses control of his powers. Beast Boy, in the form of a Star Conqueror, has unleashed spores that threaten to transform the inhabitants into animal-like creatures. Oliver and Connor investigate the situation and discover that individuals called the Resurrection Twins have targeted Star City.

The Resurrection Twins are using the city's aquarium as a laboratory, where they are conducting experiments on mutant creatures, particularly on the spores released by Beast Boy. The heroes are divided on how to proceed: Connor wants to save the creatures, while Oliver is more focused on eliminating the threat. Father and son face off against mutant creatures and try to stop the Resurrection Twins from executing their plans.

As they explore the area, Connor discovers that the Twins have used dead bodies to create abominations from the spores. While Connor chases the Twins to stop them from escaping, Oliver fights the creatures. The Resurrection Twins take advantage of the chaos to attempt their escape, all while unleashing waves of attacks on the heroes.

Oliver uses his bow and combat skills to fight the creatures, but he is soon overwhelmed by their numbers. He regrets not following Connor earlier and finds himself in a desperate situation, with the creatures overpowering him. The story ends on a suspenseful note as Oliver is captured by the mutant creatures.

| StoryTitle2         = Birds of a Feather
| Synopsis2           =Red Canary prepares to face a chaotic situation caused by mutant creatures attacking civilians. She encourages herself to stay calm, comparing the moment to a scene from a movie where she is a character facing an alien invasion. As she tries to focus, she is quickly thrown into action as she joins Black Canary, who is also fighting the creatures.

While Red Canary is impressed by Black Canary's abilities, she realizes the seriousness of the situation when she sees civilians in danger. She must choose between helping people about to be attacked by an "alligator-man" or protecting a group caught in an ambush. Hesitant, she watches in admiration as Black Canary neutralizes several enemies with a sonic scream, saving her in the process.

Red Canary continues to struggle with her doubts and fear of making the wrong choices. After taking a moment to reflect, she decides to follow Black Canary's advice, reminding her that in such moments, one must always make a quick decision and accept the consequences. This advice helps her push forward into action, continuing her mission to save lives.

During the battle, they face a new wave of attacks. A group of mutant creatures charges at an ambulance carrying the wounded. Black Canary and Red Canary fight to protect the civilians at all costs. While Black Canary engages the enemies with strength, Red Canary, though less experienced, finds the courage to fight alongside her.

However, Black Canary eventually falls victim to a Garro spore that attaches itself to her face and gradually takes control of her mind. Under the parasite's influence, Black Canary undergoes a terrifying transformation into a giant raven (or is it a black canary?). The power of this new form is so immense that it makes Red Canary feel deeply powerless in the face of her mentor's strength.

As the giant raven (Black Canary transformed) dominates the battlefield, Red Canary faces a dilemma. She knows she cannot physically defeat her transformed mentor, but she still tries to reason with her, pleading for her not to harm the civilians. Red Canary expresses her doubts but eventually finds the strength to assert her determination.

The giant raven eventually flies away, leaving Red Canary relieved. Despite her exhaustion, Red Canary decides not to stop and declares that she will continue searching for and protecting the city's survivors.

| StoryTitle3         = The Jungle Society of America
| Synopsis3           =In Star City, Red Arrow faces strange creatures. She called the JSA for help, but is surprised to see two team members transformed into animals: a giant frog (Alan Scott, Green Lantern) and a humanoid alligator (Judy Garrick). These transformations were caused by Beast Boy's spores, which mutated several JSA heroes after they disembarked from the "Steel Eagle," their jet.

Stargirl and Huntress arrive as reinforcements. Stargirl sarcastically asks if she just shot âJudy Gatorâ and âFrog Lantern.â The heroines explain that similar transformations are happening across the country. The spores seem to be attracted to the powers of certain JSA members, triggering these metamorphoses. Stargirl offers to take the initiative to attack, but Huntress tells her to stay back, as her cosmic staff might attract the spores.

The team formulates a plan. Red Arrow fires an arrow to draw the alligator's attention, while Huntress runs between cars and fires a shot. She yells to Red Arrow that alligators are slower when they turn, which is confirmed when they succeed in forcing the creature to change direction. The alligator is temporarily incapacitated.

Stargirl, seeing the cosmic frog approaching, tries to distract it with her staff, encouraging it to follow the light. She draws it in for a direct confrontation, but Huntress shouts at Stargirl not to pursue this strategy. However, the cosmic frog brutally attacks Stargirl, wrapping her up with its powerful tongue.

As the situation becomes critical, Red Arrow fires a series of arrows that break against the cosmic frog's green shield. The attack has no effect, and an explosion of light follows. Alan, the cosmic frog, ends up swallowing Stargirl, with his head swelling and glowing.

A few moments later, Alan violently vomits Stargirl, who collapses to the ground, covered in slimy residue. Red Arrow and Huntress, witnessing the scene, express concern for her. Stargirl, still weakened, jokes that she hopes they can take it from there, while holding Green Arrow's ring.

Stargirl, still covered in residue, gets up and jokes about being glad she attended biology class where they dissected frogs. Red Arrow and Huntress seriously ask if she's okay, but Huntress remains skeptical. Alan (the cosmic frog) and Judy (the alligator) are tied up, and Huntress asks Red Arrow where they can safely keep them. Red Arrow suggests taking them to Star City Zoo.

Stargirl proposes dropping the creatures off at the zoo before heading out to find the other members of the JSA.

| StoryTitle4         = ...Like Son
| Synopsis4           =Connor, dressed in his costume, is overwhelmed by an assault of monstrous creatures and seems on the verge of being overtaken. As he tries to manage the situation, he expresses his doubts while acknowledging that the creatures are not responsible for their condition. Despite their terrifying appearance, he refuses to hurt them unjustly. The Resurrection Twins are partly responsible for their existence, and Connor, true to his convictions, is determined not to punish the creatures for the crimes of their creators. He fights the creatures, using his agility and cunning to survive while searching for a way to escape.

After finding refuge behind a door, Connor takes a moment to catch his breath. However, this safety is short-lived, as the door begins to give way under the pressure of the creatures. Connor decides to use his skills as an archer and his gadgets to turn the situation around. He recalls a past mission where Robin made him sonic adaptation earbuds to confront Music Meister. Thinking these earbuds might help him control the creatures, he begins to consider how to use this technology.

He puts his plan into action. Armed with special arrows, he tries to divert the creatures' attention. As he fights them, he is suddenly shocked to see that his father, Ollie, is also in trouble, caught in a fight with the creatures. Without wasting a second, Connor changes his plan and decides to save Ollie before resolving the spore problem. He fires a sonic arrow towards the creatures and shouts, "Hey, Zombies!" to get their attention.

The creatures are quickly engulfed in confusion. Connor's arrow works as expected, temporarily neutralizing the creatures and allowing him and Ollie to regroup. As the chaos continues, Ollie fights fiercely. Despite Connor's quips during the heat of the battle, he remains focused on his mission. The two archers work together, their arrows hitting their targets. The creatures, unable to withstand the synchronized attack, are subdued.

After the intense battle, Connor turns to Ollie, and they have an emotional exchange. Connor expresses his frustration at feeling like he is never heard by his father. Ollie, on the other hand, acknowledges his past mistakes and sincerely apologizes. This moment marks a reconciliation between the two, and for the first time, Connor feels understood. They then decide to fix the situation together.

They devise a plan. Using one of Connor's arrows as a source of inspiration, Ollie suggests containing the creatures in a tank with absorbent gel. They move towards a large empty tank and formulate a strategy to trap the creatures. Once the plan is in place, they put it into action, synchronizing their shots to activate the gel. The creatures are quickly trapped, their danger neutralized.

As they contemplate their success, Ollie initiates a more personal conversation with Connor. He asks if they can talk once everything is over. Connor, surprised but touched, agrees with a smile. The father and son, reconciled, walk side by side, ready to begin a new phase in their relationship. The story ends as they walk away, united in their victory.

| StoryTitle1         = Arrow vs. The Wall, Part Two: Riders on the Storm
| Synopsis1           = Amanda Waller orders Oliver Queen to retrieve the Sanctuary files from a hidden base in the mountains. He refuses, but she reveals that she previously sent Roy there and he disappeared while on the mission, he accepts in the hope of finding Roy. Oliver and Connor travel to the base while John Diggle, who allowed Connor to free him from prison, investigates Merlyn and his connections to Waller.

They go to Roy's last known location and find a sealed metal gate built into a mountainside. They suddenly sense danger and prepare for a fight. To their shock; Red Arrow, Red Canary and Arrowette burst out of the snow and attack them. Oliver and Connor fend off the initial assault and rally. However Mia Dearden, once again Speedy after the "unknotting" of the timeline, sneak attacks and shoots them both with a taser arrow.

Mia apologises and tells them that Roy instructed them to stop anyone who showed up, no matter who it was. She helps Oliver up and he hugs her, happy to see her again. The girls tell them that Roy went into the facility yesterday and the doors slammed shut behind him, and they've been unable to get them open. Oliver notices a handprint scanner by the door and realises that it is a Justice League facility. He touches the scanner and it opens, recognising him as a Justice League member. He goes in, telling the others to hold back.

Oliver heads in and finds the central computer. Roy jumps out and attacks him, believing that he is a hologram generated by the Sanctuary program. Oliver refuses to fight back, and Roy realises he is real when Oliver calls him his son. They hug and Oliver asks him why he's helping Waller, and Roy reveals that she put a teleport device in him and is holding Cheshire hostage. Oliver says they will stop Waller, but first they have to get the files as he is planning to gain her trust to bring her down. Roy agrees but warns Oliver that ever since he was trapped inside, Sanctuary has been sending him holograms of people from his past to stop him, and now that Oliver is here the system has reset to fight him. Holograms of the Justice League appear in front of them.

They manage to leap out of the vault, narrowly avoiding being hit by the holographic Superman's heat vision.

Outside, Connor tells Roy that Lian is safely back on Earth and Oliver tells Connor to take Roy to Gotham to reunite with her. He then calls up Waller to tell her he has the files and demands that she tell him where Merlyn is. In response, she teleports him back to the post-apocalyptic future.

As soon as Oliver materialises he is attacked by Merlyn, who managed to escape the Timestream and has been stranded in the future for decades from his perspective. Merlyn tells Oliver that he has accepted his old rival is the better archer, but he is still going to kill him. He takes the mask and creates multiple holograms of Team Arrow. The holograms beat Oliver, who refuses to fight them.

| Synopsis1           = The Team Arrow holograms overpower Oliver, who refuses to fight back. Merlyn tells Oliver that he will have the holograms slowly torture him to death and throws him against the teleporter, asking what snappy comeback he has now. In response, Oliver activates the teleporter and uses it to being all of Team Arrow to the future. Team Arrow battle their hologram counterparts and Black Canary is able to disperse them with a sonic scream at a specific frequency. Merlyn tries to shoot her but Oliver tackles him. They briefly fistfight but then simultaneously grab their bows and fire at each other. Oliver is slightly faster and hits Merlyn right between the eyes with a taser arrow, while Merlyn's arrow just grazes Oliver's cheek.

John Diggle teleports in and takes Merlyn away through a portal. He tells Oliver that the implants will allow one more teleport and then deactivate for good. Oliver teleports Team Arrow to Starfish Island in the present. Roy and Lian finally reunite once more and Roy promises her that nothing will ever keep them apart again. Connor asks what they are supposed to do about Waller and the mask, but Oliver says that's a problem for tomorrow and they deserve a vacation. Team Arrow celebrate and relax on the beach until Green Lantern comes to collect them.

| StoryTitle1         = Team Arrow Strikes Back, Part 1
| Synopsis1           = After spending the day partying on the beach, Team Arrow go to spend the night in a secret vacation home Oliver built on the island. That night while the others are sleeping, Oliver looks in on each of them and then slips away. When Black Canary wakes up the next morning she finds him gone.

Forty-eight hours later, Oliver reports to the Hall of Order to begin working for the Bureau of Sovereignty. Peacemaker smugly greets Oliver and tells him that one of the Bureau's black site prisons has been broken into and they want him to deal with it. Oliver refuses as his deal with Waller was that he would not be required to do field work, but Peacemaker shows him a live feed of the surveillance cameras and Oliver begrudgingly agrees.

Arsenal and Cheshire Cat infiltrate the secret prison, a facility hidden in the mountains known as "Belle Reve North" where Cheshire is being held. They sneak their way to Cheshire's cell, following information from John Diggle. They free her but accidentally trigger an alarm. A squad of Bureau goons rushes to the cells, and the three fight them off and run to escape through an open window.

Lian and Cheshire climb down a rope ladder which they had set up, but before Roy can go down it Oliver appears behind him in his new Bureau of Sovereignty uniform and tells him to stop. Roy asks Oliver what Waller is using to force him to work for her, but Oliver claims he is working for her of his own free will and believes that she is right. He also claims that he is no longer Green Arrow and has signed his fortune over to Roy. Roy asks Oliver to come with him, saying they can work things out, but Oliver kicks him out of the window. Peacemaker comes up and approvingly says Oliver is "cold-blooded", but when he looks out of the window he sees that Lian and Cheshire have caught Roy. He accuses Oliver of letting Roy getting away on purpose, but Oliver throws him into a wall and says he won't let his emotions get the better of him again.

Back at the island; Roy, Lian and Cheshire tell the others what happened. They suggest he may be under mind control but Roy says that he looked into Oliver's eyes and he believed everything he said. Red Arrow says that they should abduct Oliver and bring him back, then figure things out from there. However, they suddenly see on the news that superheroes have been apparently launching attacks on civilians around the country, and amateur footage shows Superman falling out of the sky. Roy realises that Waller is responsible and says they need to stop her before they deal with Oliver. Connor declares that if Oliver has rejected the mantle, then he will be Green Arrow.

| StoryTitle1         = Arrows Against The World
| Synopsis1           = Batman and Nightwing call Team Arrow and tell them about the attack by Task Force VII. Roy asks how they can help but they tell Team Arrow to remain on the island, as whatever deal Oliver cut with Waller appears to have included leaving Team Arrow out of the fight, and they may end up being the only heroes left if the resistance fails. However, as soon as the transmission ends, Roy says he's not going to do that. He leads them to a new Arrowcave under the beachhouse, and says that the only person who may know of a weakness in the new Amazos is Professor Ivo, the original creator.

At the Hall of Order, Oliver watches the broadcasts of the Bureau attacking his friends. Bright approaches him and asks if Oliver is already planning to betray them. Oliver replies that he has realised that rounding up the various superweapons out there is meaningless unless they also bring the creators in. Bright says that they will tell Waller but Oliver insists on doing it himself. Bright tells Oliver that they will kill him as soon as Waller no longer needs him.

Cheshire's criminal contacts tell her that Ivo is holed up in a hidden lab in Death Valley. Team Arrow fly over and enter the lab, but Cheshire warns them that Ivo is "not Well". Indeed, when they find him Ivo is deformed and half-mad. They easily disarm him when he points a gun at them, and Connor demands to know how to stoop Task Force VII, but Ivo tells them he had nothing to do with building them and considers them "abominations". However, they are still part of his work and he won't do anything to destroy them. He reactivates the Tomorrow Woman and runs away.

Lian and Cheshire chase after Ivo while the rest of Team Arrow try to fight the Tomorrow Woman, but find that she is too powerful and she quickly overpowers them. Meanwhile, Ivo is captured and arrested by Bright before Lian and Cheshire can get to him.

* This story takes place between the events of {{c|Batman Vol 3 150}} and {{c|Absolute Power Vol 1 2}}.
* When Team Arrow encounter the Tomorrow Woman, Arsenal mentions that Ivo and T.O. Morrow created her to infiltrate and destroy the Justice League, as shown in {{c|JLA Vol 1 5}}. This confirms that the events of {{v|JLA Vol 1}} are canon following [[Dark Nights: Death Metal Vol 1 6|the "unknotting" of the timeline]] in [[Dark Nights: Death Metal|the last Metal War]].

| StoryTitle1         = Get Ivo!
| Synopsis1           = In the woods, Oliver Queen digs up a box which Martian Manhunter entrusted to him, as it supposedly contains the world's most dangerous weapon and the key to destroying the Justice League. He looks inside the box, and the object inside casts a green light on him. He closes the box and calls the Bureau of Sovereignty for extraction, but they tell him that Bright already took out the personnel carrier, claiming he was acting on Oliver's orders. Oliver realises Bright is going after Professor Ivo and starts running out of the forest.

At Death Valley, Tomorrow Woman drops Team Arrow out of the sky but they are able to save themselves with their parachute arrows. Tomorrow Woman dives down towards them, her landing sends out a shockwave which knocks them over. Tomorrow Woman grabs Roy by the throat, ranting that because of him Ivo will never fix her and she won't get to be a hero again. Connor approaches her and reminds her that Ivo created her to destroy the Justice League and he doesn't need Ivo. Tomorrow Woman glitches and collapses, Connor catches her and says that they will get Mister Terrific to rebuild her. Roy says they still need Ivo, and nearby the Bureau's plane takes off. Roy realises the Bureau has Ivo and they run back to the Arrowplanes. He calls Lian and Cheshire to join them, but Cheshire reveals that they are already on the Bureau carrier.

Roy pilots the Arrowplane to chase after the Bureau craft with the others standing on the wings. When they get close enough they launch cables and zipline onto the carrier. A squad of Bureau agents with jetpacks burst out of a hatch and attack them. Meanwhile inside the craft, Cheshire frees Ivo from his restraints and he offers her money to betray Team Arrow and help him escape. Cheshire agrees immediately, to Lian's disapproval, but Bright comes into the hold and easily overpowers.

On top of the craft, the battle is turning against Team Arrow so Roy puts it in autopilot and rappels down himself. When he lands, Bright comes out carrying Lian and Cheshire, telling Roy to pick which one of them he kills. Cheshire breaks free of Bright and he says that he will murder Lian, but suddenly he is shot with an arrow in a weak point on his armour. Everyone looks up to see Oliver swooping in on a jetpack.

| Synopsis1           = Team Arrow defeat Bright and his guards, with Oliver and Connor fighting Bright blindfolded to counter his light attacks. As they fight, Bright reveals that he is from Earth 3 and was his world's White Lantern, until Oliver's counterpart Deadeye betrayed him for his ring and left him for dead. Oliver manages to push Bright off the plane, confident that he will survive the fall, and takes control of the craft. He flies them back to the Hall of Order, where to Team Arrow's shock he hands them over to the Bureau of Sovereignty to be imprisoned.

Oliver shows Ivo the plans for Task Force VII and Ivo tells him that they possess "chrono-healing" which makes them effectively invulnerable; Oliver then lets him go. Later in the Hall of Order basement, Oliver builds a mysterious device using Time Commander's hourglass and the contents of Martian Manhunter's box. Black Canary, Zatanna and Doctor Light enter via the Dark Roads and Black Canary demands that he explain himself. Oliver says he's doing what needs to be done for their family and activates the intruder alarm. Dinah tells him that they're about to storm Gamorra and asks him to come with her but he refuses and the heroines leave.

Waller calls Oliver up to the control room and tells him that the war is coming to them.

| Notes               = 
* This issue takes place after the events of {{c|Absolute Power Vol 1 3}} and {{c|Superman Vol 6 18}}.
* Bright mentions an event known as the "'''Brightest Night'''" taking place on [[Earth 3]], a counterpart to the [[Blackest Night]] and [[Brightest Day]] events on [[New Earth]]/Earth 0. This indicates that [[Crisis]] events on Earth 0, like its characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{c|Superman Vol 6 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also mirrored on Earth 3.
* There are major continuity errors in this story:
** Bright mentions Power Ring who is shown to be Harold Jordan. However, Jordan died against the [[Starro (Earth 3)|Starro Collective]] many years in the past of the [[Dark Nights: Death Metal Vol 1 7|reborn]] continuity of Earth 3&lt;ref name="CS1"&gt;{{c|Crime Syndicate Vol 1 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and could have never been a member of the Syndicate;
*** In the flashback, he also doesn't wear his [[Emerald Knights (Earth 3)|Emerald Knights]] outfit;
** The Crime Syndicate is shown to be an actual team in Bright's flashback. However, they banded together&lt;ref&gt;{{c|Crime Syndicate Vol 1 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; not long after the rebirth of the Multiverse&lt;ref&gt;{{c|Dark Nights: Death Metal Vol 1 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; so their clash against the League on Earth 3 from this issue (and [[Forever Evil|their invasion of Earth 0]]) should have never happened, making it temporal paradoxes, like the existence of [[Lois Lane (Earth 3)|Superwoman/Lois Lane]];&lt;ref&gt;{{c|Infinite Frontier Vol 1 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Deadeye is implied to be Oliver Queen's [[Earth 3]] counterpart and Bright states that he died some time in the past. However, Queen was still alive and [[President of the United States]] during the rise of the Crime Syndicate,&lt;ref name="CS1" /&gt; which take place just months before the arrival of Amanda Waller on [[Earth 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{c|War for Earth-3 Vol 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Notes               = 
* This issue carries the legacy numbering {{c|Green Arrow Vol 1 350}}.
* The arrest of Peacemaker and Peacewrecker from the "''Trial by Justice''" story takes place days after the defeat of Amanda Waller in {{c|Absolute Power Vol 1 4}}; the rest of the issue takes place before the events of {{c|DC All In Special Vol 1 1}}.
** Oliver Queen's story chronologically continues in {{c|Green Arrow 2024 Annual Vol 7 1}}.
** The "''A Change of Scenery''" story takes place after the events of the first story and {{c|Green Arrow 2024 Annual Vol 7 1}}.
* According to Oliver's words from the first story, only a few months have passed since his "death" at hands of [[Doomsday (Prime Earth)|Doomsday]] in {{c|Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths Vol 1 6}}, his displacement to space and, then, through [[Hypertime]], the return to Earth 0 and his involvement with Amanda Waller from [[Green Arrow Vol 7|this volume]] which is obviously a continuity error as all these events span from late 2021 ([[Dark Crisis]]) to late Summer 2024 ([[Absolute Power (event)|Absolute Power]]).
| Trivia              = 
* Oliver says that Amanda Waller "gave me a Justice League when I was rejected." This is a reference to the [[Justice League of America (Prime Earth)|Justice League of America]] formed by Waller in the buildup to [[Trinity War]].

| Notes               = 
* This issue retells Donna Troy's story in the [[Dark Nights: Death Metal Vol 1 7|reborn]] continuity of [[Prime Earth]].
* The death of Robert Long's death is mentioned by Donna throughout the issue. However, she is unaware that the boy is actually alive, like [[Jeffrey Holt (Prime Earth)|PJ Holt]] and [[Cerdian (Prime Earth)|Cerdian]], who were also rescued from death by [[Granny Goodness (Prime Earth)|Granny Goodness]] to serve as her [[The Furious|Furious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{c|The Flash Vol 1 799}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The issue mistakenly features Lilith Clay as Omen during a flashback set around the events of [[Tales of the Teen Titans Vol 1 50]] despite her only becoming Omen years after during the events of [[Teen Titans Vol 2]].
| Trivia              = 
* Antithesis being reintroduced as the Teen Titans' first villain was first mentioned in the DC Timeline from {{c|New History of the DC Universe Vol 1 2}}.
* Sensation Comics is a comic book about [[Wonder Woman]] on [[Prime Earth]]. All the authors mentioned on the fictional issue have worked on the character, including [[William Moulton Marston]], who created [[Diana of Paradise Island (Earth-Two)|it]].
* Kanigher Orphanage is obviously named after the late DC writer, [[Robert Kanigher]], who has worked on Wonder Woman for 22 years.
* One of the two Teen Titans fans wears a [[Teen Titans Go!]] shirt.

==Notes==
* This issue continues retelling the history of the [[Dark Nights: Death Metal Vol 1 7|''reborn'']] iteration of [[Prime Earth]]. The events depicted in this issue span from the aftermath of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' to the return of Barry Allen in '' [[Final Crisis]] '', adapting the ''[[Modern Age]]'' events within the continuity of [[Prime Earth]].
* There are many changes to the DC continuity: &lt;!-- to be updated --&gt;
** According to this issue, the Supergirl who died in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' is the one and same Supergirl who debuted in ''[[The Supergirl from Krypton]]'' storyline. In the new continuity, Darkseid resurrected her, rather than her having come from Krypton.
*** However, as mentioned in the issue, the Matrix Supergirl existed in the past of Prime Earth. This was first shown in {{c|The Return of Superman 30th Anniversary Special Vol 1 1}}.
* Many events and concepts are missing in the new history of the DC Multiverse: &lt;!-- to be updated --&gt; 
** The existence of the [[Thanagarian]] Hawks&amp;ndash; Katar Hol and Shayera Thal&amp;ndash; is completely missing. However, many events from across the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', ''[[Infinite Frontier]]'', ''[[Dawn of DC]]'', and ''[[All In]]'' eras have shown that Katar has existed&amp;ndash; until the ''[[Death of Hawkman]]'' storyline&amp;ndash; on Prime Earth and Shayera is still alive as of {{v|Green Lantern Corps Vol 4}}.
*** The "''Heartbreak Lake''" story from {{c|DC's Lex and the City Vol 1 1}}&amp;ndash; implied to be canon during Shayera's appearances from ''Green Lantern Corps''&amp;ndash; explicitly reveals that Katar and Shayera disguised themselves for a time as [[Carter Hall]] and [[Shiera Sanders]] during the "[[Modern Age]]" in the new continuity.
** It remains unclear whether the Earth-born Supergirl, [[Linda Danvers (New Earth)|Linda Lee Danvers]] has existed at some point in time on Prime Earth.
&lt;!--* There are also several inaccuracies in this issue: --&gt; &lt;!-- to be updated --&gt;
* The DC Timeline is based on research by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Dave Wielgosz]]. There is also a special thanks to [[John Wells]].
